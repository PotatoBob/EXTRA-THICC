Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
She's not a...
Have fun tonight?
Did you change your hair?
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
Why?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Oh, God.  It's starting.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
I thought you hated those people.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
You told me that part already.
Two legs, nice rack...
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
Forget it.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
Okay?
You're not okay.
Why'd you let him get to you?
I thought you were above all that
Kat! Wake up!
Maybe.
Who?
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Yes
Tell me something true.
Is that a request or a command?
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
Is that right?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
So you got cozy with she who stings?
You were right. She's still pissed.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
What just happened?
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
Your life, and that of others!
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
What are you listening to?
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
You come!  You speak first!
Chief says -- how many?
Chief says -- he has a God.
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
May I speak freely?
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
No, he is here.  Shit...
But it's...
I know.
They're not gonna send you right back.
You better get packed.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Only one guys checked in?
Yeah.
No.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
Describe him.
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
This isn't homicide school.
You goin' to the escort service?
Mind if I ride along with you?
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
Yeah.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Eddie, are you okay?
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright?
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Stop it.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Yeah.  I promise.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
That's unique.
Any chance we can do that again?
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Did you hear what I said?
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
I'm serious.
No, I don't get that!
Emil???!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
We spent it!
Yes, the money is good.
We started over, you can too.
Robert...?
Viewer discretion advised!
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
What are you coming here to do?
How did you start the fire this time?
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
It's about my salary cheques.
Really.
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
What is it, Hal?
And don't you worry about it.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
She's in the bathroom.
How many days until you come home?
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
That's right.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
You got a name, cop?
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
No class...
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
Hey, how'd my car get here?
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
Hey, there she is...
Yeah?
What the bell happened?
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Yeah.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
So do you...been a long day.
Doesn't look like it.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
I guess he got the message...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
Jack, are you okay?
Jack, wait...
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
Keep stallin'.
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
Give it back.
What're you laughing about?
Who are you?
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
What's she doing?
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
I was talking to the cat.
At least, the cat comes back.
The Fifth Element...
Other than that... You all right?
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Six to the left. One to the right.
To save the world.
Just one... why me?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
Cornelius..
You're nothing but a... a...
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
Talk English Doc.
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
Welcome home.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
How's the detective business?
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
Why the gun?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
You couldn't?
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
There's nothing harder.
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
That's five thousand dollars.
Machine.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
Where's that?
You brought the money?
We do.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
I know what you did.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
Why?
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
You're making me very angry.
You're asking me why?
Remember me?
I'm not a cop.
How much?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
Alright, I get the picture.
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
You don't need to be here.
What's this?
My condolences.
Pittsburgh?
Do you want to tell me what you found?
I told you I can't, not yet.
You don't have any other choice.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
Neil... Neil Cole.
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
I don't know.  I think so.
What is this?
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
Okay, I'll take it all.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
You alright?
You what?
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Rick, please.
About Freddy?
I gotta get out of here.
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
It's lonely in there, in my room.
But how...?
Hi, beautiful.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
You're right.
How was the meeting?
Sobering...
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
Who's Jacob?
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
How is he - ?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
So they caught up with you, too?
I guess.
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
Is there any way out of it?
What course, Skipper?
The frogmen?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
Huh?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Are you alright, Wade?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
No.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
How soon?
Yes.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
You think so.
I used to play ball.
They said.
Hmm.
This way.
No brag. Just fact.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Lawford?
Why do they do that?
You know.
I guess they're stupid.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Are we going in this?
Pop?
Nothing.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
I know.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Huh?
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Lillian!
Yeah.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Did you get his number?
I still don't understand --
For a while.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
Said what?
You don't mean that.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
How?
This is nuts.
It makes me sad.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Something about my father?
You remember Margie Fogg?
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
Bang!
Rolfe.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
There was something. It happened up your way.
No shit.
Who?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
That it wasn't an accident.
Yeah.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
It's cut.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
I prefered the terrorists.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Why?
About goddamn time.
Nine.
Tower, here.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
Now, or he dies, please.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Four...
Stop.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Twenty minutes?
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
You know what?
Flying the plane.
The fax machines.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
Yeah, right.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
I might still have a few chips left.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
What?
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
That just doesn't make any sense.
Felt like a large asteroid.
Te...!
Ted, what's wrong?
Elaine, what happened to us?
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Ted, we're taking off!
Not now, Elaine!
What word would you use, Elaine?
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
I mean for Ted.
I'm so excited, Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Simon, what's happening?!
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
Roger.
Negative.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
He's a boy dog.
All right.  Here.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
Captain, how soon can we land?
Can't you take a guess?
A hospital? What is it?
No. No one that I know of.
Elaine!
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
Yes?
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
How ya doing, honey?
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
Hi!
I'm Randy.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
In there.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
How the hell do you know that?
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
You know that guy?
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
Where'd you get this?!!
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
What is this?!
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
You think this is the guy who did it?
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Hope their plumbing's the same.
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
And it's too late to shut it down?
Hear me out...
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
You're just reading me.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
What did you say?
I'm sorry, Newt.
No, it's different, honey.
How many colonists?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
How do you know?
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
You might be disappointed.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
What??
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
I want to go!
Now?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
No! No! No!
Em iram! Em iram!
Don't be stupid.
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.
Why not? Half the house!
No one.
No. Don't answer it!
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
He's doing his best.
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Be careful!
Upstairs.
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
It's just a trifle, of course.
Really?
What? On one hearing only?
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
Yes, Sire.
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Why are you here?
How many pupils do you have?
You don't have secrets from me.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Why? What has happened?
Is he working?
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
Put it down!
Well, we can.
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
What for?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
I'm sorry. No.
Herr Sommer.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
But what is it they don't like?
Yes?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Shall I answer it?
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
Yes.
What time?
Yes.
Yes.
It couldn't be simpler.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Mozart -
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
Where?
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
But not his body.
Oh my son, my poor son!
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
I agree, Baron.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
I'll call tomorrow.
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Oh, Miss Price?
Yes, sir.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
Surely you're not suggesting...
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
What do you dream about?
I know.
Now what do you want to talk about?
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
That's easy enough.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
Charming.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
I've left those pills for you.
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
No.
Chart says he's from New York.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
She's a jerk.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Okay.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
I have no idea.
Yeah?
Heathcliffe.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
What?!
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
We were attacked by a werewolf.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
Stop it, Jack.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
You look awful.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
Hello.
Do you have any hot soup?
Then you have some hot tea?
And what, Sergeant?
I don't rightly know, sir.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
Where's Matt?
Let me have ten bucks?
Charlie!
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Oh!
know, but
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
What is?
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Yes, of course.
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
Good morning, Helen.
Oh!
Sure, I think it's swell.
Mine too?
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
No.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Well . . . ?
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
What time was it?
Then who changed it?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
This is the best score yet.
Swear.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
Oh no...
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
Beg pardon?
What?
She had a moustache.
It was exciting.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
So what do we do, General Lee?
It's not a bank.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
Still smells fishy.
Fine. We hit this bank.
I'm out.
The safe. Now.
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Then why can't I go in there?
So?
He thinks this is some kind of game!
That would have made an impression.
You're doing just fine.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
This has been a good year.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Jesse, are you awake?
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Not if I find the right girl.
Where will you find such a girl?
You are a hell of a woman.
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
I'm not hanged yet.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
... too young for whisky...
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
How can that be?
Really!
Yes sir.
That.
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
This is no game.
I demand action.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Yes?
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Nice?
Eight?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
That's nice.
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
Lucky, I guess.
Uh huh.
What?
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Just...say...no.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Forget it.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
No. Flattering, but no.
No. I really don't.
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
Uh huh?
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
Don't tell him you're here.
No.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Who do you ask?
Would you rather I not smoke?
No. Not really.
He had a yacht?
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Oh.
Have you consulted a psychic?
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
I lost my job...
Speak up. Come on.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
It's...it's...all right.
Oh well, you know.
No, Owen.
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Milo --
Great!
...What?
Here we go.
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
Is it your software?
Cool!
Milo. What's up?
You really wrote this just today?
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
I'm okay. It's going well!
Wait... He knows.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
Lisa.
You know mine.
...Were you?
You're compulsive.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
They'd frame him.
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
What about "60 Minutes."
Does he know you know?
Did you tell Alice?
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
Yes?
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
Excuse me?
Do I make you horny?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
I can't see a bloody thing.
A limousine has just pulled up.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
Fancy a nibble?
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
No, did you use a condom?
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
What do we do now?
Lay it on me.
I love you, Austin.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
We've got a lot of work to do.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
Umm, that also has already happened.
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
He's asleep.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
Seriously?
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Love...
Promised? Who promised?
I'm afraid that's impossible.
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
What are my choices?
I had a spot of bother at the door.
Much better.
My father always wanted a boy.
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
But why? What's the point?
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
And I suppose you're the knight.
As per mother's instructions.
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
Strange.
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
And do you trust me?
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
What is it?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
Where's Mother?
I see.
Peter's brother?  But --
Who's now vanished.
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
We want Mrs. Peel.
Steed
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Weather's turning nasty.
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
Why?
Where?
I feel sure of it.
Let it be rain, please let it be --
If you say so.
Does Cole know about this?
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
Not interested.
The car for Debbie?
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Fine. How's everything going?
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Nice shot.
Yes, sir, I am.
I can't sleep.
Um... that's very relaxing.
You better not have too much joy.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Let go of me!
Yes...
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Are you sure this is a good idea?
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
The end.
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
What the hell is that?
Under the table!
How 'bout this?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Just come down, John. Just --
Who asked you?
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
I like what you've done with the place.
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
Hey, what are you doing here?
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
You look great.
Really? No kidding.
When I was twenty.
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Hey.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Got anything to drink in there?
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
Where are you going?
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Completely out of control.
Aren't you even curious?
Management were pin heads.
Who's going to die?
Where's Sean?
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
He treats you okay?
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
Look, I'm sorry I --
Anyway, down here, take a look...
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
He works for me.
-- Burn them.
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
So what are you doing here?
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
I forgive you.
Large?
Let me think about it.
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
What case?
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
Yeah, him.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
What's that?
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
No offense.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
But the line has to be drawn.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
Four minutes ago.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
How did you end up here?
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
You lost me.
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
I'm in till the end.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
Just want to say good luck.
We both lied to him.
Don't make me have to use this.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
Where are you from?
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
I thought you got rid of...
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Yes!
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
I see.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Is he all right, papa?
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Bill Styles...
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
What do we do?
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Why not?
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
You shot Childs and Nunez.
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Do what?
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Where?
Back up.
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Where's the cabin?
How do you know that?
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
Sir, yes, sir!
Jesus, what happened?
Roberto, what the fuck?
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
I don't know --
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Yeah.
You think you could explain all this to me?
They're taking your command, aren't they?
Ah, Christ
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
He's in interrogation?
Move him.
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
They got their stories straight.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
You wanted to get the truth.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
Four --
No bodies, no West...
This isn't the time --
West?
Nah.
Your phone number?
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
Maybe we shouldn't go.
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
No one else heard it?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
Thank you.
Bloom like a flower?
Yes.
You won't find a better place!
Fine, I will.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
How old are you?
Eighteen.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
That's terrible.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
Jesus Christ.
You think I'm up for it?
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
I will.
I thought you weren't dying.
Did I ever tell you about how...
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
Tell me how it happens.
You say...
'Fraid so.
How did you know my father?
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
You need to go.
I talked with your father last night.
They met at Auburn.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me 150.
You know what for.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
Do you want to stop?
Leave him!
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
I need to know who you are first please.
Good. 
We better watch him. He's crazy.
I...
Tell me.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
He wants the money from your bank.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Yes.
Syevodnya?
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
No I don't.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
Where's the restroom?
What?
Give me some money.
It's none of your business.
He will come back.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
I don't hate you.
I got what I paid for.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
What?
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
You know you can come under the blanket.
No. I think I better just go.
Whatever.
Why?
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Yeah, I know.
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
This was very sweet of you.
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Holy shit.
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
You been home yet?
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Teh... Tehronne?
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.
What?
No ma'am.
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
Let go of me...
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
Tell me what to do.
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
Why you say that?
What'chu sayin'?
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
I feel better. Do you?
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
I think she got to you, pappy.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Why?
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Let's grab some food.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
Connie...
What happened?
Why weren't you at the platform?
Yeah...
Know her?
Ichiro --
Where does this Sugai live?
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
Nick, you can't do this.
I don't know.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
He drinks.
What if I chant?
What...?  What if I say no?
Why me?
He was my partner.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
Why tell me this?
He knows what he's doing.
One man.  He must be good.
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Got it.
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
I think I have no money.
But I would like to buy you drink.
What's that?
Yeah?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
It's a good job.
Jeezus!
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
I bet I would.
It's artificial?
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
Dead.
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
You're sick, Deckard.
Ten years.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
If she is, the machine works.
What?
You want to go home?
Just better.
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Your mom was a dancer?
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
Come where?
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
You're lost?
Wait!  Wait!
How's that?
I can't, it's yours.
Who are these people?
My Mom and Dad.
Very funny, smart ass.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Okay.
This is for me.
I don't want to be alone.
I didn't know that.
Everybody's divorced.
When do you need her by?
Never drive again!
Sure.
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
I certainly do!
No it's not!
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
No way.
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
Yes, Eve?
Hi, Eve!
Is this because of the radiation?
A card?
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
Gerade aus dann links!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
Then why go there?
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Uh, I think they have.
And it's called...?
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
I just don't want to.
You bet!
Of what?
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
You don't look thirty-five.
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
Oh, no.
I've noticed.
If I...you know...
Why?
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Get the presents and do the lights.
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Would you excuse me?
We stay down here.
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
Well, I am the head of this household--
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
He didn't leave with them.
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
Oh, no!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Buy it from me?
Wolf One -- say intentions.
To your health, Frank.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Are you Detective Williams?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Come into the study a minute.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Shit. You better tell me something.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
Never before this.
No.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Then don't talk about killing.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Are you a bad boy?
What do you want?
You like to open me, don't you?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Come on Dorothy.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Do you love me?
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
Dorothy. No!
Oh he forced you, huh?
You want to see him too, right?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Hello?
No thanks.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Hey? You like to walk.
What are you lookin' at?
Yes.
He comes over to study.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Are you feeling okay?
Yeah, how did you know?
Oh yeah?
Am I bothering you?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Are you alright?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
What's the plan.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
You want to tell me about it?
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Yeah?
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You better not, Jeffrey.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
You worry about me really?
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
You didn't tell him about me?
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Come on out a minute, okay?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Up where?
The Duke?  What did you do?
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
Anybody see ya?
You guys?
We're here brother.
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
What?! What are you doin'?
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
He got beat up by a girl.
Destroy all that which is evil...
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
Nervous?
We do not want your tired and sick.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
And number three, Dolly.
Uh... two shooters!
They were wearing masks.
How do you figure?
Pee...Per...Man.
What?
Who the...
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Promise me boys.
Right now.
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
So?
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
You believe?
You feel?
Yes.
Open it!
Just be natural, goddamit.
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
Why?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
I'm lookout.
Dignan, calm down.
Is that the manager?
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
Yeah.
What's wrong with him?
Can I get that credit card from you?
OK. Go ahead.
You owe me fifty bucks.
It's not a plan. It's just --
Hi.
What the fuck is going on here?
As long as he gets out OK.
Obviously. That's a given.
He's gone. He stole the car.
Where was I?
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
Why don't you come with us.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
We've got sixteen dollars.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
What do you think?
Eleven fifteen.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
He did?
How big is it?
What?
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
Congratulations. You passed the test.
Did Dignan take the test?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
Yeah.
You're Anthony?
Wait. Did he see us?
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
You're paranoid, Bob.
What happened?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
Come on, Dignan.
The elevator broke.
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
I might have mentioned it.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
You keeping out of trouble?
Is he in?
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Oh, yeah.
Can't get it. It won't... 
We're closed, sir.
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
It's locked.
What do you mean?
Treadstone.
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
...this is Conklin's computer.
Do you know what his budget was?
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
That's not what happened to your parents.
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
No... How?
-- where's left to go? --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
There must be another way!
But you found another choice.
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
So when was I here?
Oh, shit...
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
Looks like he's been detained.
-- go -- take the van! --
What? The tapes?
That's where we came out.
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
Yes. In that order.
Wallace has sacked York!
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
What is it?!
No, M'lord.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
Rest, William.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
I wanna have supper waitin'.
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
No. He did not.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
You scare me.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
Yes.
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
What the fuck are you doing?
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
What do you mean?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Because you're... different.
Know what?
Where are we going?
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
I don't get it.
And...?
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
...yes.
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
Lung cancer?
I come from a big family.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
How long have you been married?
You want my advice?
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
Yes, I come.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
Hello, Rick.
What do you want for Sam?
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
Yes, something.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
We said "no questions."
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
You can believe that if you want to.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
Where is Rick?
I must find out what Berger knows.
Ask me?
Yes, Victor, I was.
Are you ready Ilsa?
Hello, Rick.
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
Go ahead.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
Well, this might come in handy.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
My bill.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
-- Thank you.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
Hello, Louis.
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
Oh, but I just told you. --
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
What friend?
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
I have the letters right here.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
What is your nationality?
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Just a little something of my own.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
Worse than Warsaw.
Do too much, I'll die.
You're beautiful.  Marry me.
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
He's your cute thing.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
Her name's Hannah.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
That about sums it up.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
This is so unfair.
You okay?
It means a lot...that you came.
You too.
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
I am one lucky guy.
What happened to your pants?
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Can you find her?
But I might not have.
I'm touched.
You fucked us over.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
And never take.
You are one sick fucker.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Hello.
To Wilson.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
That's all there is.
I need to do it.
May I ask, where are you bound?
Only if you can afford it.
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
Why not?
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
So, Mrs...
Burma!
You don't miss it?
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
How is that Wally doing?
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
I can't go nowhere.
So many children. Are they all orphans?
There! You said it was boring.
I thought they might take me.
You mean somebody asked?
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
*Liver* killed him?
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
I don't remember.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
Where are you going?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
In other words, scurvy.
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
I am not a doctor.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
Uh... sure.
Rose Rose?
It's just my heart.
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
But you don't look very happy.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Now, now. He's a good boy.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
She took off in the night!
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
What's this?
The standard ten.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Know who I am, Jake?
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Grifters...
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
You're a superstitious fucker.
It's not true.
Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
Mob?
Fuck that. We're going too.
Moonan. Here. Shit...
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
When?
I guess it lacks a certain style.
You can't cheat an honest man.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Look at you, you skinny prick.
I think I just broke my hand.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
Mr. King, I think --
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
How do you deal with --
WHAT?
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
What do you want? An apology?
Your mess.
Miles...
Why?
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
What happened?
So what do you want?
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Speak.
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His "Fix."
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
You sell it.
No. Thanks.
I'll take you up on that.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
I don't gamble.
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
I couldn't resist them.
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
Are you drunk?
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
I hope it brings you luck.
That girl, she works at the casino --
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
Really?
Leave me alone, Marion.
I've lived there.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
To coincidence.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
He doesn't gamble.
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I'm in trouble.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
The point is, they want a man inside.
Next time it'll be my neck.
I can't do it, Jani.
What for?
Yes.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
Jani! Where are you?
Who...
Where do you live, Jack?
You've done pretty well.
What the fuck are you talking about?
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
You're talking about complicity.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
Any exceptions?
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
What makes you so sure?
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
She's not in the gaming business is she?
That hair will have to go.
I just want the job.
How do you feel, Jack?
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Energy shielding positive function.
It is intuitively obvious.
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
Right!
To explode, of course.
And you can only do it once, right?
That is correct.
Yes, well...
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Any planets?
What are you gonna name it?
-- open circuit breakers --
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
You know what I think about, Talby?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Oh yeah?
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Negative effect.
That's correct, sir.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
None of your business.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
Can I say something in my defense?
Out there.
You're light a deuce.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
I don't want to move away.
But why can't we stay here?
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
No...
Sophy?  Are you okay?
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
Sorry about your window.
Wasn't that hard.
Too early to tell.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
Well, not me personally.
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
What do you want?
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Look, I don't know what you want--
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
Got a pencil?
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
That's odd...
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
Who are you?
Right, the big one-oh.
Lydia.
A toy?
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
How'd you get her out of town?
I'll give it my best shot.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
Huh?
Got any KISS?
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
Namely?
Whoa... she just farted.
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
Go ahead, Jam.
Mom, what're we...?
I did it! I did it! We won!
Simplicity, Hawk.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
Gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
I feel bad for his family.
Theoretically.
So... that's it?
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Like a spear.
Beg pardon?
When can I squeeze one out?
Why did you make me flood the school?
Who is... we?
Where did you come from?
You have a request?
Wanna walk me home?
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
And what?
We're moving through time.
Who?
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
Grandma Death.
Do you get to meet Ed?
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
Yes.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
Do you think a lot about girls?
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
What else do you think about during school?
Nothing.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
Regret.
What else makes you feel regret?
That I did it again.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Why would I tell Mom?
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
How much are they paying you to be here?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
What?
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
Rose.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
Airport Ho-Jo!
Amber...
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
Mom!
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
We was robbed.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
This, this... This is bullshit!
What?
I just did.
Yeah...
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Hi.
Loretta, shut it.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
All right, then.
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
This is -- what?
"My President"...
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
But you're my father -
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
No, but I shot some ducks.
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
Then I demand an apology!
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
It must be done right away.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
I thought everything was working out fine.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
What do you mean?
John loves the house.
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
What is it?
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
Good morning, sir.
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Yes sir.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Well, yes.
How are you feeling today?
How long has this man been here?
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Tell me about it, please!
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
Thank you very much.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
Righteousness...
This... is my new home?
The hospital?
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
Yes, John.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Watery headed bunch.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
I said welcome.
Those things in your hands.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
Erik. You don't understand.
But you don't realize....
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
I shouldn't have come.
Is it night or day, Erik?
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Is there something the matter with it?
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
What?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
"But" what?
What did he say?
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
What's the matter with them?
Wait, Erik!
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Hy-Brasil?
Sven!
You know, my son, our lord said...
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Aaagh!
Get away, Snorri.
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
Sh! Hurry!
Help!
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
KILL! KILL!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
Yes, Mother.
And something to sharpen them with?
Yes, Mum.
Yeah, you told me that later.
In the room?
What's wrong with me?
Why what?
Well, I didn't want to assume.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Rockville Center.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Okay.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
You like that?
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
I'm fine.
Well, I should probably get going.
Yeah?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
Oh, yeah.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
You're not ready.
Joely...
Yeah, Tangerine?
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
Egad, were you horrified?
Right. Something black though.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech really well.
You said...
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
You know what I did.
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Me too. There's this poem --
It's dark.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
I think I should go back.
I can't stop thinking about you.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
So then she just stops calling.
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
Where?
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
Howard, your one o'clock.
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Is that Nietzsche?
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
It's no big deal.
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
Is everything getting worse?
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
How does she like what in bed?
Going north?
For magazines?
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
Coop, where are you...
Will it work?
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
How is he?
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
Do you hear it? Right there.
His peritoneum has ruptured...
What does?
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
Justin, finish your sweep.
Patch me through to him.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
This is Weir.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
What's the hold up?
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
Skipper...
It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
I can see that, what're they for?
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
You have something, Dr. Weir?
The date.
Don't... don't do this...
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
No, no, we just got her back together...
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
Oxygen is not the problem.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
We can take the filters from the Clark...
What about the life readings you picked up?
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
You've got to listen...
He's been past Mars?
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
No. I saw nothing.
Get them back --
How?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
Oh, he did.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Ben?
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
What did you wish for, honey?
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
I had it at four.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
No more cracks about how I look.
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Feeling better?
Which was?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Ben did this.
I understand the business reasons.
Raising the shields.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Please don't make this personal --
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Why?
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
Well...
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
Why don't you call me up tonight?
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
Did you get her name?
I would. Yeah.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
Sensitive -- what is that?
I thought he was out of town.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Do you think guys find that attractive?
What variables?
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
That little prick.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
I want romance.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
You better save some for me, you swine!
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
What about those other guys you live with?
...I've got to go home.
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Really?
Anything to drink?
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
What do you mean by that?
O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
That's good...
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
That's what gives me The Fear.
Not much. Why?
When does this thing stop?
How about a check?
Jesus.
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
You degenerate pig!
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
You realize...
I don't know what you're talking about!
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
They'll be back.
Where are you two going?
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Where's that?
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
So, your husband ditched you?
We just smeared a skunk.
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
We're better off.
Come on!
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
Two.
Max?
Nine?
Shit!
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
Well, maybe they migrate?
Okay, well that's something.
What're you doing?
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
Frances.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Sort of.
Claire?
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
Without me.
Dick, we need some time apart --
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
No.
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
I know.
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
Thank you.
You're poisoning that child's mind.
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Fifteen.
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Are you really serious? About acting?
What?
Don't touch me.
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Quietly.
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
The chauffeur. He's watching.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
How the hell do you find me anyway?
Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
Take a walk, pal.
Evening, gorgeous.
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
Yeah. I don't know.
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
Why do you say that?
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
Yeah.
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
The speech? Real good.
Why are these all opened?
It's your fan mail, little sister.
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Haven't you heard what I said?
Where are you going?
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Please sit down...
Normal. Average.
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
You what?
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
I am as he made me. In his own image.
It can't be as bad as that.
You're an outcast.
Yes. Very close
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
Materials. Nothing more.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
You dance so beautifully together.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
And you?
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
I've loved you all my life
I wish to be your husband.
Our decision. Together.
Victor. I love you,
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
I was just clearing my throat.
Can you think of a better reason?
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
Yes? And?
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
I have always loved him.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
Preposterous.
Creature? A... human like creature?
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
The killer is still out there.
We should go now.
You want to leave?
You think you're gonna last all summer?
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
How come you're leaving?
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
Marcie?
How come?
I'm sorry.
Claudette...
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
Roll him over!
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
I love you.
Are you wet?
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
How many with you?
Just my son and I.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
So do I just follow you?
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
Why do you want to stop?
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Sorry, I need everybody.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Real McCoy.
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
You won't let him touch her?
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
It's the bitterest of pills.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
About two hours from now.
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
What you said to me in the room.
Yeah.
Are you okay?
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
Whatsamatter?
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
You can't come in here.
Best in Mexico.
No.
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
What does that mean?
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
They broke when you fell.
I'm lookin' scared?
Where are you right now?
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
He needs our help!
That's what I hear.
I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Uh, ma'am.
So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
"In Washington..."
You really came back for more?  Of this?
At first.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
I think you look beautiful.
Sure, sure.
She part of the training?
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
Say again, sir?
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
That's not right.
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
I take it this file is still open.
That's cuz I'm married to you.
What?
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
Think we can fit up in there?
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
How do you know?
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Did Romeo have a name?
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
Merde!
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
What sample?
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
Thanks.
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
Go ahead!
What?  What?
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
And note the sucked in gut.
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
What do you mean?
What?  Up?
Systems register functional.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
You Okay, Alex?
We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
Where are the miners?
Oh, they're so cute.
We're doing episode 31?
We're alive!
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
You know, that's really getting annoying.
I heard it too.
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Wait. What did you say?
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
Weapons storage...
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
Could be this.
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
What's your frank estimation of the British?
And a French alliance?
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
Well, George, who were you?
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
Who is that!?
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
Yes, I believe so.
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
Oh, come now...
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
I only meant...
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
My God, what?
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
That's right...
I think I heard that.
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
General Greene?
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
That's a lie!
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
The land here is best for grain and corn.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
You get the money?
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
Where is my nephew?
He's around someplace.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
There's Ilona.
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
Where's Karen?
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
Depends. Who's this?
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
Sovereign.
You live in Miami?
You're an investor, is that it?
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
You just did.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
What's it called?
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
Just a thought.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
What do you get out of this?
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
Martin, look at me.
Wait. How about this?
How'd you know I was here?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
That's right. Three percent.
What're you doing here?
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
"Cotton".
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
I don't know.
What took you so long?
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
Harry -
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
Damn mind of it's own.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
I don't know. Tuesday?
What?
Roger?
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
A what?
What?
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
What about running number two by itself?
Damn barbaric is what it is.
How do you mean?
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
Morning everybody.
Then why didn't they take it.
Any dizziness?
Lights?
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
Who?
There's somebody else on this boat.
Got your light?
Murphy to Epps.
He needs a doctor.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
Showing you what?
That much I think we've already established.
I must be in the wrong business.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
What now?
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
How're you feeling?
You don't remember?
Fifteen, at the most.
Who?
Give up?
Not the Maxine?
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
Well, yes...
What do you mean?
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
That guy rules!
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
Do you want something to drink?
Yeah, right...
That's just the way I am!
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
This is so bad, it's almost good.
Hi.
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
What are you talking about -- who?
You call.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
Ew, look at this...
What? How long have you been standing there?
Let's go hassle Josh.
Where did you get that?
Anthony's II!
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
You're just jealous.
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
Don't you want nice stuff?
You're insane.
What thing?
What happened to Seymour?
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
Why? What did he say?
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
Hi.
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
Shhh!
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
Every guy has a type!
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
So is that your boyfriend?
Well are --
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
Relax, Seymour, relax...
Yes, that would certainly do...
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
Hey, can I borrow this?
Are you okay?
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
That's the spirit!
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
So, what happened?
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
...I better not...
Well when can we do something?
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
...What do you mean?
I had to see you.
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
I hate sports.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
So where would we go?
What do you want?
No... forget it...
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
No... they said she was here...
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
What are you talking about?
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
You were contracted to work-
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
Morning, friend, glorious day.
Am I to take it you want to live?
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
We have hunted since childhood.
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
...misfire... it jammed...
Think about something else.
I'll have to.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
I expect so- it's from my wife.
Soon. 
You like him, don't you?
You've known him long?
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
Four should do it.
Where do you go next?
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
What are you working on, Egon?
Does he ever mention me?
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
That's where the buggy stopped.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
Does she know anything about babies?
I'm not even good for me.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
Should we go?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
I await the word of Vigo.
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
Get on with it, counselor!
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Like what?
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
Hello, Venkman.
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
So far so good.
Who was that?
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
Are you all right?
Tell him about the toaster.
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
That's a violin concerto.
You really don't act like a scientist.
Like a used car salesman.
Well, let's check it out.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
Goodbye.
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
You must have gotten the last copy.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
Oh, that's very - unusual.
In the physical sense.
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
I don't believe in luck.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
Has this ever happened before?
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
Great!  How's it going?
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
May I please see the storage facility?
Why do you want to see it?
At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
What have you got, Egon?
Did you see anything?
What do you mean "bad?"
Does she want to be?
Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
Who?
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
So do I.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Third floor.  Get down here,
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
How do you know?
Agile bastard, isn't he?
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
That's what you told me two days ago!
Don't you think you should at least wave?
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
Not yet, dear brother...
Then you'd be out of a job.
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
You cannot die.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
So I understand.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
Quintus is overly idealistic.
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
How much money is involved?
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
What is the matter?
And it's all over now.
What's the matter?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
That woman --
I thought he said by the monkey house.
I said I think it is.
All right then! Yes!
Elaine -- I love you.
Then what?
Please let me go.
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
I don't know.
I'll think about it.
Tomorrow?
I just don't think it would work.
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Yes.
No, Benjamin.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Yes I am.
Yes, I will.
You a student?
One of those outside agitators.
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
Give me an hour.
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Where is your luggage?
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
Yes.
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
What?
Well I don't know.
It's all right.
I know that. But I'm --
What?
He didn't see me.
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Will you bring me a hanger?
Wood or wire? They have both.
You what?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Are you tired of it?
How about art.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Him?
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Not particularly.
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Don't talk about Elaine?
I wish you'd tell me.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
What?
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
But if it's sickening for you --
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Now it seems to me --
How?
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
Then you'd better start believing me.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
They don't know?
What about it?
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
Swell. I appreciate it.
You'll never be young again.
What?
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Hello.
No, I don't.
Hello.
Yes?
Benjamin -- where are you?
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
Dad -- can you listen --
I want to speak --
You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
No.
Why?
What about the money?
He must be very nice.
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Oh -- work!!
Oh!
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
That was lovely.
Would you like to make a man happy?
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
Yes -- tired...
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
You do believe that I really love you?
When are you leaving Berlin?
Very early in the morning.
I can't.
No?
Not at all, sir. 
Yes, quite.
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
I thought she was splendid!
I think it would be much better if you went away.
Be quiet.
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
You like music?
You're trembling.
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
You pay me.
You...
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
That's from skiing.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
You're a little too fast.
Hello!
Well?
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
Of course -- of course. 
Baron!
I had to arrange about the trip.
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
Oh, no.
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
Then, it's all over?
You see -- what we are interested in --
Oh, come, Madam -- please come. 
Good morning, Suzette.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Madam should sleep.
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Last night?... There was no applause.
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Certainly, sir.
I don't know you.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
Permanent damage.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
So here we are!
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
What? He's going to be all right!
Well, make it stop!
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
What is?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Roy Dillon.
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
Bluebell came in?
Lucky? You call that lucky?
Going somewhere?
I just came back from Phoenix.
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
You want a drink?
For God's sake, Lilly!
That's right.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
I want to know everything about you.
You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
I'm a salesman.
The long end. Big con.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
Is that right?
Where?
Take a hike, you mean?
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
You -- I don't know.
I went out to Delmar.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
And hello to you, too.
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
Sure. Let's get it over.
Mr. Simms.
Well, thank you. And thank them.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Well, when you put it that way.
Carter.
Carter.
Do you know who did this?
Checking out your place.
Nothing's missing?
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
Forget it.
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Get on the bus.
I'm not leaving without her.
Better?
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
What are you looking at?
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
I thought you were allergic to latex.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
What is that?
Where's the child?
Yes?
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
You know what gets me?
Oh, shit.
At least!
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
You know what gets me?
Go to the funeral?
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
Maybe it's time you got out.
Me?
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
How are you, honeybunch?
I forget mine for years on end.
I've considered that.
For Africa.
Hello.
You were about to ask a question?
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
They were in the same creative writing class.
She has a master's degree in English literature.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
I don't know.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
Nothing.
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Gee whiz, Dad--
Sir?
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
Give us time.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Your old beau?
Paul said you were awfully sick.
I did?
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
Which one?
People don't use that word any more.
What are you going to do?
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
I'm going to call the police.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
How do I load?
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fianc is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
Wasn't that sweet of me?
This is man to man.
Yes.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
Hands and knees, you say?
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
It's trash now, like mine.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
Leave the rifle here.
She did?
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
It is an emergency, isn't it?
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
Far as I know.
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
We made the date three months ago.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
This is very good for us.
What kind of a life is that?
You know each other?
Is that a fact?
He died of a massive rupture.
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
Yes, we do.
I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
What?
Now, what do you want?
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Just one.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
That's all you got, three girls?
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Yeah.
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
Are you sure it's all right?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Tod might know.
Half now, half later.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
No.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
No.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
It's not quite the same thing.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
But then you'll forget about me.
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
No.
They are?
I don't know.
The police? They know less than you do.
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Where'd you hear that name?
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
Wes, do me a favor.
What is going on?
What plan?
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Where does he hang out?
I don't know.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Rucker.
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
What exactly do you have in mind?
You ever play Chicken?
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Jake'll take care of me.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
You are at the University, Candy?
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
None of that, lady.
Officer, I can explain.
Where are the papers?
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Wait here.
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
Harold Chasen.
What?
Yes.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
How about some ginger pie?
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Why do you say that?
Because they are all the same.
But what?
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
No.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
What was that?
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
I like you, Maude.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Yes. They're old friends.
I took them out.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
Mother.
Mother.
What?
A rough estimate.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
No.
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
No.
Then why did you leave?
Yes.
No.  I'd have liked to.
Why?
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
Well, I don't...
Harold!
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
It's different for us.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
No bad dreams.
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
Then why are you here?
Where am I?
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
Here. You'll need one of these.
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
We're on the move.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
Sir, may I go first??
That voice --
Don't move. We --
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
What was that??
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
Out? Out out?
You're going alone?
Hi.
Cocky.
That you feel that way about me.
Yes, I --
Alright, let's give it another try.
That your daughter?
The box... you opened it. We came.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
No.
You remember.
Oh my God.
Oh.  Oh yes.
Well can I come in or not?
What happened to you?
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
Hell...
Don't you care?
What happened?
Like who?
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
Shit.
It's probably going to need stitches.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Are you all right?
Who was it?
Don't go upstairs.
Drinking alone.
What are you drinking?
No, not much.
Am I?
I got through.
Call me tomorrow.
Big house.
I've forgotten.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
No you don't.
Where are you going?
I thought we'd lost you.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
Meaning what?
Steve. Thank God you came.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
We'll do it next Monday.
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
I have a television.
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
That's what I said.
Uh.  That's me.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Nice friend.
What's his name?
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Huh?
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Rob --!
What is this.
Are you coming home?
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
What's the obvious stuff?
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Fine.  One.
Nevermind.
I guess.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
You still together?  Going all right?
You know I'm a good person.
Mmm hmm.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
No, no.  When are you going home?
Do you want me to be there?
When are you going back?
What?
You know the difference.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
Nothing.
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
Just local, of course.
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
Would you marry me if I was?
Rob here.
What's the -- hey, Liz --
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
What difference does it make?
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
So you live in Chicago now?
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
That way.
I'll call you.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
I think you have more.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
I'm Vince.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
Nice.
Claymore.
Why?
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Good reflexes.
What will you do now?
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
I'd rather hear yours.
You had to do _nothing_!
You're wrong.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
Maybe it would do us both good.
Why are you here?
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
I didn't kill the watchman.
There are differences.
I'm just curious.
You and I should talk first.
What are you getting at, Moran?
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
What were you doing in Felton?
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
Yes.  Always.
Does it change with me in the room?
It is as you are.
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
Oh please.  Another one.
Something pretty.
Not so scared.
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Are you sure?
What are you doing here?
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
Of sorts.
We have some unfinished business.
It doesn't.
Home.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
Are you back?
What's the idea of locking this?
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
Too hot?
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
Yes, wasn't it?
Did you finish the interview?
Hildy!
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.

Well, of course, if you put it that way.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
I notice you still remember it.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
What do you mean by that?
You bet I've got a better offer.
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Get away, Svengali.
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
Say, could I meet him?
Allow me.
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Yes. Where is he?
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Ring that number, will you?
Will you come here?
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Anything you want, Boss.
Sure, boss.
I'm busy, Duffy.
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Well, that about covers everything.
I call. What you got?
Give me a hand with her, will you?
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
Goodbye, Yonson.
Little rum in yours, too?
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
Take your paws off me!
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
He's harmless.
After all I've done for you --
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
I won't.
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
Now, Hildy --
There goes another scrub lady.
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
You fight it cut.
Did you get that, Hildy?
Look out, you --
Come on with that money!
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
Isn't that her picture?
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Earl, you must never do that again.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
You mean here in the city?
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
I know.
Why?
Give him the you-know-what.
I never was.
I know a secret.
What's that?
Bloody.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
Who pays for them?
Air-raid?
What is it?
Where?
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
Naturally.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
Here's to music. And absent friends.
Has Sue got it right?
And where do you think you're going?
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
What is it, pet?
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Up to six weeks, I think.
I can't do it. What's the point?
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
Father, that's enough now
What did I do to deserve this?
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
Ma, Tiny's in.
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
But suppose for a second you did.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Should we stop?
Why are we stopping?
Go around him.
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Check this out.
And...
Is that all... think real hard.
I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
Goddamn.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
When?
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
Rise and shine.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
A couple hours!
You find something, Georgie?
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
I'll go. It's my fault.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
This is way too fucked up for words.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Thank you.
Who's your Daddy!
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
Fit the profile?
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
I guess not.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
Tell him, Harold.
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Say my name.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
Stop. Get away.
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
Hunh.
My apologies, madam.
Very well.
I want to be the way I was before.
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Progress!
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
So?
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Lila, it's Rosie.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
Where?
You are a therapist, right?
I like you, too, Nathan.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
Do you?
Of course.
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
What?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
No.
Really?
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Extra dessert?
Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
Ugnh.
Unn.
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
About sixty, seventy bucks.
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
That's right, Miss Packard.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
How?
How much?
Will you take a check, Bert?
Cut.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Only when I work.
Yeah? Why?
Poker's not your game.
Why?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Where do I sign?
What's that supposed to mean?
Hey, Findley's here.
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
'Bout even.
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Whaddya mean?
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
Give me a drink, will ya?
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
Go to hell.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
A son.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
With what?
Aw, Eddie.
Just like that?
Findley.
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Yeah. You must come again.
Hi.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
How long have you been waiting?
What bus?
It's the lights. And the scotch.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
You don't look like a college girl.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
How did you know my name was Sarah?
When you've got money, you'll pay.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
What's this supposed to mean?
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
You wanna drink?
No. You?
You need the words?
A week? A year?
Leave now.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
California. Oakland.
That's right.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
Thousand dollars a game.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
You lived like this once.
That is not now, human!
Yes.
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
That's who you are too, Emma.
I surrender --
We're going to be moving, son.
A meteorite, Dad, look!
You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
What's wrong, Ellen?
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
Where, Jimmy?
I swear it was here.
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
What's his family background?
Why, yes.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
David? How'd you get this number?
What do you want me to do?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
Spunky. He told you about that?
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
I'm thinking.
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
Get us out of here!
With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
How're we doing?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
I'm a dancer.
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
They let you out?
Yes.
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
An old man's dream.
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
Are you sure?
You said go between them!
What are you going to do?
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
It's important!
Don't call me that, please.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
Look, can we discuss this later?
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
My lucky charm.
The floor's on fire! See?!
What???
Dad!
What?
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
But, Indy --
Why are you trying to kill us?
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Lao She.
What's that?
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
That's far enough!
Give me the stones!
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
You don't look very good.
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
A what...?
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
What?!
Can you move your arm?
What's happening?
It's starting to let go!
He's afraid of something.
Any more complaints?
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
Yes.
No... they won't kill me.
Give me your hat...
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
I said something.
Where are you,...Al?
It wasn't him.
Who was it?
Me.
Yes.
I just got here.
Yeah?
Somebody's been here.
I told you, my name is Al.
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
I know...it sounds insane.
What for?
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
You're not crazy.
Hear voices don't I.
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
What'd he look like?
I want out.
I don't know...To get Al.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
I don't like the sound of that.
Go out, take your first left.
Take a left and your next right.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Who did?
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
Just scratched my arm, why?
I'll get in trouble.
They'll know who I am.
It's just not enough.
Try another language.
What do I do?
Wait.
Without your pants.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
Just don't show fear.
This just won't work.
What if she says something important?
What am I supposed to do?
You shut down your sensors.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Don't you think I stand out like this.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Come on, she's getting away.
Probably.
It's him.
Not sure at all.
What was it? What'd I say?
Well...?
Now, you're too suspicious.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
Awwww...
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
No!
I'm...scared.
Impossible.
How about a deal?
...Foreign service.
What things?
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Who...are you?
Well what?
Oh....Sure.
Why would we want to hurt you?
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
Just give me the keys.
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
What did you say?
Nothing.
The poet...something he said...
And you.
You mean from it.
You again.
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
As if your mind's not all there.
I am sort of scattered.
Promise you what?
You're talking to me.
You're doing...Okay.
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
Why did you stay with me?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
You're leaving.
I'm just on vacation.
You know where he went?
One chip?
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
Oh sure.
Who was?
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
Get us one.
Where what?
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
So do I.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
What a mess.
Why did you, then?
Don't worry.
He can't help us.
It wasn't me. It was him.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
You can't take that.
Why not?
Tear it apart?
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
Three hours.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
What do you mean, what's it do?
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
When's the air date?
Sure.
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
You're taking "no" for an answer?
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
I'm not touching my film...
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I didn't want to leave it there...
Yeah.
No classes this morning?
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
What are you and Mike going to do?
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
Yeah.
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
So, is everything okay?
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
Lowell.
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
Give me a break!
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
You charge by the hour?
You believe that?
I heard.
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
Where are you, anyway?
Just give me an example...
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
Where you staying now?
Right.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
Excuse me?
Grounds?
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
He's the wrong man.
You have the pre-nup?
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
So who'd you hire?
No.
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
How nice.
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
To him? He's a sick freak.
Howard is a beautiful person.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
She didn't love you?
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
I want to be your -- your wife.
Did you just propose to me?
You do?
Miles.
You don't like me?
I want to nail you ass.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
Marylin!
Now. But first, he worked for you.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Income tax evasion?
Rex. Get away from the door.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
I was devastated. Of course.
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
Do you know him?
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
Shit.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
Well, that's about to change big time.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
What?!
Did Marylin end up with money?
Where does that leave us?
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
I don't know. I can assume...
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
She brought my digestive enzymes.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
Miles.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
I might.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
Never mindI'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
Peter Warne! 
What do they say?
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
All right, let it go.
I beg your pardon!
Are you talking to me?
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
I didn't ask for your advice. 
Of course I do. What do you mean
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
You'll find the showersand thingsright back of the second cottage. 
Like this. I have no robe.
Where'd you say the showersand thingswere? 
Where is the shower?
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
I refuse to resign!
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
This isn't "piggy-back."
wasbut
Sure.
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
No. But I've got a penknife. 
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
What if nobody stops for us?
You're an expert, I suppose.
No harm in your coming to see us.
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Get out of here!
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
What!
That she's going to marry somebody else.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Yeah.
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
You send telegrams here?
Who?
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
Keep saying what?
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
You still questioning any Cubans?
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
What was so appealing about Houston?
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Then who killed the President?
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
I had the cause of death.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
No, you don't!
Four to six.
Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
I don't believe it!
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
Honey, you all right? 
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
Hi.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
The Warren Commission call him?
Allen Dulles?
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Where is Banister in all this?
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
She's the best damn witness we have!
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
What are they?
I understand.
Who?
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
What's the problem?
Uh-huh.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
Why were you with him?
You got a good lawyer?
She sound scared?
She wants to go back to work.
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
You know who put the dope in your bag?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
What did they want to know?
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
With ten thousand? Nine.
He's got that kinda money?
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Yeah, if I cooperate.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
How do you feel about getting old?
You're not old. You look great.
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
Does it happen to all men?
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
You think he's got a thing for you?
Has he hinted around?
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
That's my job.
You're rationalizing.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
Tell him you want to see him?
I never lied to you.
Madrid or Barcelona?
What if I plead guilty?
Most of the times.
You know what we want.
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
What for?
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Yes. All those things are true.
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
There was a guy with Melanie?
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
What about you?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Killian's.
Dreaming.
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
I understand woman, damn!
Yeah?
You told em? You told em it's me?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
So where did you go?
Where were you?
No.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
Lemme have the bag.
I'm carrying it.
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
So we on the same page then?
I didn't look like a bum.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
What does that mean?
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
Couldn't talk to her?
Pretty sure.
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
Maybe the Feds got it.
Jesus Christ.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
That's Winston. He works here.
It's in my bag.
Ten thousand sounds high.
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
Livingston, huh?
Yes.
I got some more business for ya.
What does she do for you?
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
Winston found you.
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
All I did was walk out with it.
And where's Jackie?
Have her bring the money here.
My money's in that office, right?
No.
He's around.
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
How do you know?
It's short, huh?
It's cold.
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
But the paper ...
... I've seen them, too.
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
What can I tell you?
Her knee acting up?
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
What's your name?
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
Gee, thanks a lot.
I moved the couch. That's all.
What do you think?
You up?
They're weird names.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
What's in here?
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
I'm going home.
When was the last time I said a word?
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
It's gone to the top.
What'd the doctor say?
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
I love you, Jez.
I know.
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
He did? When?
What's he talking about?
Don't!
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
Who was that?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
Me neither.
You've lived with me for two years.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Long time ago.
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
You come here often?
And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
I'll page him.
Lennox Hospital.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
I work in a bakery.
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
Why the hell we drivin' here?
You can't talk in Brownsville?
Why not?
I don't know what to do.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
Oh God. I know. I know.
You come home with me.
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
Can we blow it with just two?
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Where the hell were you?!!
Creepy.
Shit!
We're not supposed to do that.
Kay-Em!
How many?
I am an expert!
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
We need weapons.
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
I couldn't save them.
You?
You wanna release your air tanks?
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
I'll help you in.
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
Hurry! She's lost it!
Robot huh?
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
What good will that do?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
Guys, he's right behind us!
Son! -- Out of the water now!
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
I never saw one that big.
C'mon. Middle appendix --
Probably out in the back yard.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
It's three feet deep, Martin
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
My kids were on that beach...
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
What the hell?
And nobody else saw her in the water?
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
This is Quint, Missus.
Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
I'll drink to your leg.
Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
So, what do you think we should do?
Is that normal?
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Um, hi?
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Wizard!
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
Can we make out now?
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
What is your job title, exactly?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
Like what?
Commercials.
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
Hey, I like this.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Cute?
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
What?
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
What's the matter?
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Elbow.
Juno? What's going on?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
The Penny Saver sucks.
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."
Hly shht!
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
Yeah, downtown.
It's a loft.
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
Adele for god sake please lis...
It's a portfolio of my work.
Carryin' a gun.
...Anything else?
...That's not true.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
Can't hurt.
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
That bad?
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Yeah.
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
Thanks. What are you doing?
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
A book on the warehouse murders?
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
There's more...
...never?
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
Could be.
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
...Diebold?
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Well, how was it?
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
How?
Right.
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
Yeah.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
Yeah. Why you give money.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Shut up.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
Na.
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Right now?
I was lookin' for you all day today.
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
Tonight?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
Telly is at Steven's?
How old are you?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Your a real philosopher.
The pain. The fucking pain!
Mine?
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
I'm coming.
What happened?
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
Yeah.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
What are you guys doing?
To come?
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
Yeah.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
You are!  I don't like you.
How'd you get in here?
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
Yes you are.
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
How is she?
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Did anyone stand out?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
How?
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
What makes you think I was there?
Very good.
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
Why did he what?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
You ready?
You mean, no prints but hers?
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
And this Jeremy--
The most logical choice.
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
Are we going to go through this again?
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
What do you see here?
What are they, please?
You.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
I know it was bad.
I thought you said the line was busy?
Nothing.
I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
But I do.
It could be anything.
I'm not nervous.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
I don't know how.
Take the western passage.
The new Queen lives.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
The Fortress moves?
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
No. She must agree of her own free will.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
The spiral begins in the west.
You're coming with us.
No! You cannot know that!
Even by you?
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
We must try to get horses.
These we'll pay for.
You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
Can't I come, too?
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
I only want one.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
I don't think it's working.
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
Freylag's stronghold?
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
It is the time.
Knowledge I wouldn't want.
Many have perished in that maze.
Who speaks that name!
She bore you many children?
You had a son.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Of what?
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
You lie!
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
What's that man's name?
OK, I'm fine.
Huh... 500 meters?
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
A little...
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
...I don't know.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
You say it just to calm me!
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Huh? Why?
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
He probably just went somewhere.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
So what's the deal Maurice?
You have?
Yes?
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
Anything?
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
I don't know.
Where?
You don't have to prove anything to her.
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Nine.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
Umm, no.  It's just that --
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
I'm walking there Kris.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
Where am I?
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
I don't have kids.
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
No alcohol?
Water?
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Do you want to fuck now?
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
If I was I'm sorry.
You OK out there?
Me neither.
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Sera you are crazy.
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Don't you like me, Ben?
Ben?
Why?
I know that...
I am planning to go out and do some work.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
How much, do you think?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Yuri... are you...
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Did you get it?
What are you talking about?
So everything you just said --
What?
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
I don't know.
You can't even imagine.
That's terrible!
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
Licensed attorney or family member?
Uh -- family.
Relation?
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Too demure?
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
Your scrunchie?
Don't ask.
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
What the hell is that for?
You really think I'm attractive?
Is he the only one?
No -- it's just -- not me.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
What're you doing here?!
Why not?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
You're beautiful.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
No.
Well, yeah, but --
You look -- nice.
Elle?
Is it a Kappa?
What?
Always.
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
Like some vile toadstool.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
Might we watch, too?
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Cathay?
Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
Who might these friends be?
It's bluebells!
What!
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Don't you know?
And if she thinks me a liar?
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
I should hope not!
Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck.
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
There aren't enough arrows.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Can you save her?
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
Never show mercy!
He'll not escape me.
I was with the Princess.
And did you?
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
How're these?
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
A gentleman would offer water.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
What happened?
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
I'm afraid it may storm.
So, he's hiding in the dark...
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
Not very precise directions.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
As fair as me?
I don't believe you.
Only that?
And am I not fair?
How so?
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
Praise be to God.
Up ahead!
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
To Castle Couer de Noir?
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
You look better without make-up.
Really?
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
We're not gonna do anything.
Why are you so uptight?
I thought I was helping you.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
We've known each other since grade school.
Forty.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
I did warn you.
I don't know.
I'll be around to check up on you.
Why?
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
What would you be doing now?
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
Can you build a house in four months?
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
It's okay.
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
A blueprint spool.
Where have you been for a week?!
Why would they tow your truck?
Money?
I love those doors.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
Back.  Neck.  Back.
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
Does Alyssa know?
He said he heard hammering.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
I can't go right now.
You can't go because of Sam?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
I've missed you guys.
Can you stay for dinner?
You're sure about this?
Why?
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
Yes, it is.
Is Mae Rose okay?
And the baby?
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
Sharp.
Yeah.
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
Married?
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
My daddy gave me this watch.
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
It ain't here.
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
Forget it.
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
On your behalf. What happened to we?
Does that mean I'm in?
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
We'll just get off at the next stop.
I don't know. Who do you want?
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
I'm not working on a plan.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
What the hell are you doing?
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
Back to New York for starters.
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
Don't make me take them away from you.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
What is that?
Made just for you, Cookie.
How about some steak sauce?
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
Is everyone here?
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
Me? Willie Long.
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
Hello, Cassius.
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
I'll call her later.
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
Wow. What... what did she look like?
Valerie's crying!
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
Did you just talk?
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
I know, your wickedness.
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
You got the wrong window again, man.
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
If you want to.
It's freezing my hands.
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Basically, yeah.
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
I think I'm floating.
We're going to Jersey?
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
That's better.  How do you want us?
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
Your own work?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Had enough?
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
I'm fine...  See you...
What's wrong, Available?
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
And?
Maybe... sure...
About running, dying what?
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
Please? What friends?
I wish I could help you.
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
I -- I can't.
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
You know, Jessica.
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
Is it inside the city?
Are you sure?
Hello.
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
More... many more.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
We'll keep a watch on the house.
Me, too.
I can't see you tonight.
He'll kill us.
I don't know.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
Pornos.
Yes.
Okay. Thanks.
Yeah.
No.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
He's not Madison?
Something wrong?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
At your house.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
I called, you know.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
I had a dream about you last night...
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
But...
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
Okay.
Mr. Eddy?
I missed you.
Sheila?!
What do you want?
Why don't you like me?
I didn't know you cared.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
All of it?
What about those men we met this morning?
Uh-huh.
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Uh-huh.
Okay, brother.
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
Yes!
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
Yes.
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people
Just call me Barney.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
Yeah. You know.
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
Where is your mad pilot?
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
When was all this?
Very often.
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
No porters here!!
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
Now, what would you like to do?
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Just what I needed too.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of
You can't leave, George.
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
Yes.
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly
What do you suggest?
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
You think we're nuts.
No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
Why?  What are you gonna do?
What?
I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
Something's wrong here.
What are you doing?
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
You coulda told me what you were doing.
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
Yeah, Kay?
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
They went right to the President.
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
Can you see the balloon man?
-- but he didn't.
Just some guy... they found.
From where?  D.C.?
They were performance pieces.
I can't even stand up --
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
Kill type?
Don't worry, Lamar.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
And who the hell is that?
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
Yes.
You set me up...
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
Stop --
What happened?  Where's the rest?
Come on!
What the hell.
Who are you?
The precogs were wrong.
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
The what?
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
What's so funny?
You're talking about the precogs...
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
Why should I trust you?
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
Tell him not now.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
You have an emergency call on your private line.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
Precog Deja Vu...
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
No, I wanna kill my boss!
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
I don't know, why?
Cream and sugar.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
They've never been separated before.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
You sure? I just made it.
I can take you down there.
So, wait, you're from where?
We're in Fashion.
Is he cute?
Should I fuck him?
He's alright.
We used to take baths together.
What the fuck was that about?
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
With what?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
What's his name?
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
Ruiz tied in out there?
Quick drop. In and out.
You like the ponies?
I didn't say that.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
Where's the drop?
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Can you check?
Any time, bro.
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
Bullshit...
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
It's not even yours.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
How'd you unlock my phone?
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
What? Did she say something?
I don't know.
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
This is bullshit, man.
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
You know this guy?
Yeah.
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
C'mon, man...
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
Float me a hundred bucks.
Eighty five.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
No more, man.
Let's just go now and wait.
No. I'll wait here.
Hey, boys.
Where's the surprise?
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
S'up.
A little.
You strapped?
'Strapped?'
Don't drag my ass into this --
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
You're from LA, right?
A lot of Persians?
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
Yes. You're going to New York.
Keys.
What about my keys?
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
No...
So, we're talking money laundering...
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
I am.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
What?
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
Where am I gonna start?
I don't know how.
What points?
Let's talk about you for a change.
Yes. Did you eat?
Hush your mouth.
The talk is everywhere!
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
Let some of us come down there.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
I assumed...
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
You know that gal?
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
What mission?
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
Watch your tongue, boy.
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
He told you that?
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
So you are going to talk me to death.
[Why?]
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
[Who killed her? You?]
[Who's the boss?]
[Who are you?]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[Who's he?]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[The ransom was ten.]
I'm here.
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Time will tell.
Not at all?
You're fast.
No.
Where?
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
Yes.
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
You're late.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
Then be trained.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
For an American she understands this country very well.
[You have the money.]
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
Yes, mom?
She's young. She'll get over it.
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
[Is that good or bad?]
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
You helped him get this job.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
I'll call her up.
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
Waddaya gonna do now?
It's early.
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
Ah?
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
Yes, I know.
I'll wait for your call.
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
Where you going now?
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
So these two girls come over to the bar...
You want a beer, Ang'?
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
Tommy...
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
You  must  open  me  up  again?
I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
When will he be able to write?
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
Frank...
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
Ayuh.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
Excuse me, Sergeant.
How much time do I have?
You don't aim to cause any trouble  But?
Yes, that's what I mean.
O'Reilly!
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
How is he?
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letterand stick by it?
Oh. Yeah.
Hello, John.
Can I help you pack?
Ted Sheldon.
I guess so. Then what happened?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Did you write this?
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
The letter from John Doe.
Oh!
John Doe.
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
I got it all ready. Here.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Who's got him?
The heelots!
Ba-ll!
Yeah. That'sthat's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
I want it as soon as possible.
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shotyou forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
That's a lie!
That's a lie! Listendon't believe what he says . . .
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started
Oh!
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
Not that we know of.
Floor seats.
What happened? Is there a problem?
What happened, Mike.
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
Really?
Hold on a second here.
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
...a car.
You can't kill me like this.
Satisfied?
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
How did you like Toronto?
We see each other every couple of months.
Yes.
The 6 horse is still last.
How much you wanna bet?
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
Please. I'm begging you.
Hey.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
What do you want from me?
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
Yeah that's it.
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
When?
You like this place?
It's very nice.
There is?
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
Stay here, don't move.
Hmm?
Yeah.
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
What?
Your concern is heartwarming.
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
The guests are here.
You are not a God.

No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
But boss, what about their parents?

What do you mean "basically"?
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
Anybody see them?

I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.

Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.

They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
You got men on Profaci's place?

And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
It'll just be a few minutes.
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
I'm glad ya come.
You boys carryin' pieces?
This business is about taking risks.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.

And the Jews?
I don't fuck my partners.
The terms will be mine.
You disrespect our tradition.
Masseria's been after me too.
Anything!
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
DEATH!!
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Back? You're sending me back?
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Oh my God...you're proposing?
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
What?
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
How are you doing sweetheart?
Well, they were right out in plain view.
But I was dusting.
Mother, I ...
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
Mm hmm.
So, you come here all by yourself?
... Oh ...
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
Moscow.
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
Thanks very much, sonny--
What's he bringing pigeons for?
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
Yeah.
What?
What?
No--not offhand--
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
Why me?
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
What!
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Are you ready for him, Bill?
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
Mr. President!
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
Ah, now, that's better.
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Certainly would, Joseph.
How's Amos, Ma?
Can't you?
What's your name?
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Right.
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
I also answer to whistles.
No!
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
Don't mention it--
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
But--I've done everything I--
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
I know that.
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!
You want to see me, Senator?
What do you want, Senator?
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
Jim!
Mr. President...
Order!
Who's that?
Most every day.
They think he's pixilated.
Yes, sir.
No. Are you?
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
You are , aren't you?
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Have you seen the papers?
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
Huh?
That depends on what they see.
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
What's that?
Really?
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
With pay!
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
With pay!  She is out the door.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is
You try it.
Yes, sir.
Sit over there, will you?
That's pretty.
I can't find him.
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Yes.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
What for?
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Huh?
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
I'm Chairman?
my wife wanted me to tell you she  she prays for you every night.
Yes?
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Proceed.
Uh-huh.
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
What do you think you're doing?
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
You came home last night - without them.
I did what!
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
Hey, did you hear that?
Doubtful. What did he say?
Uh-huh.
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
Why not?
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
No?
What?
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
Where am I supposed to eat?
Lily.
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Sure I can, Lionel.
Got a license?  But no car?
Don't need it.
Hiya, Doc.
We're going for a walk.
What?
No.
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Please... forgive me.
I've offended you!
No.
Where?
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
I'm glad.
Okay...
But...
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
That's not quite what I said --
...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Well, there's Lily.
Amazing.
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
Who else knows?
I can tell you anything else.
It wasn't the best situation.
You were messed up, man.
English Lit.
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
I guess that makes sense.
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
And then killing your sister.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
You will not believe it.
No women allowed.
You lie.
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
Can you swim?
I'm not?
No... Why?... Should I?
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
I was mistaken.
But he's just a filthy criminal?
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
Do I?
Much less go outside.
Come on, baby!
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
I got it.
Are you with me... or against me?
Against.
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
Who?
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
I just want to be a superhero.
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
There's a big difference.
I'll drive.
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
Maybe there was traffic.
You guys going to a costume party?
Really?
Mother... it's not what you think!
You did?
She likes you.
Don't crunch the leaves.
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
What do you mean?
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
What do you have in mind?
I'm not insulted.
And where is the army?
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
Impossible, I don't believe it.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
Would you like some brandy?
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
What's your name?
Lisette La Croix.
I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
No... nothing at all.
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
Are you trying to insult me?
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
I cannot promise you that.
I don't understand you.
Promises mean nothing.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
Yes.
I wrote it.
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
Yes, sir.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
That's it?
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
Why you say that?
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
You straight?
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
Why?
It works.
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
You're welcome, Unc.
I don't know.
Huh?
Why didn't she put'em out?
All damn.
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
Craig, remember what I told you.
Smokin' what?
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
I do.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Hey.
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Where did Craig move to?
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Debo!  Debo!
What?
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
I'll take you later.
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Need to lose some weight.
I threw my back, again.
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
Ah.
You were very nervous.
For not believing you.
Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
Don't you threaten me.
My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
Will you promise me that?
All right. Kisses to you.
I have to do something.
Oh, man...
That's right.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
Yeah.
Thanks for the shine.
Gimme a dollar.
What?
Laughs.
You have, huh?
Close your eyes.
I've got something for you.
You got this under control?
It's under control.
That's enough.
Come Back.
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
I'll bet.
Here they come.
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
O, she's all right.
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
She went.
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
What can we do, Mother?
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Bluebeard!
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
You, Pearl. You swear too.
You better not sing that song.
Why?
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Huh?
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
What's taking you so long about it?
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Sure, that's no secret.
Why, pray tell?
Pearl and John.
Our honeymoon.
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
She took them kids with her?
What's wrong, John?
What are you after them for?
When did I ever?
Now who was this?
Yeah.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
The killer.
How you doing, pal?
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
She lived there.
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
Did you sleep?
I won't.
And then what happened?
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
When did you have a nightmare?
Tell me... what else did you have?
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Yes.
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
The Duchess...
Good morning, Gaston.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
Comrade Kopalski...
Comrade.
A cow?
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
What's that?
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
How are you, you three scoundrels?
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
...and Kopalski.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
What can I do about it?
Don't hold that against me... please!
What business?
Private.
Yes!
I must get into that country of yours!
What for... why?
You, please.
You might hold this for me.
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
And where are we?
Suppress it.
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
Yes, it is.
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Then you don't want me to go there.
Yes.
What do we do now?
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
Wounded? How?
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
Glorious, analytical...
I must go.
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
Then how did you get here?
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
I have never heard one.
Yes.
You see? Life can be so simple.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
Shhh! Shhh!
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
Not white, darling.
All right, we'll make it red.
I know... it's the Russian soul.
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
Has done what?
Hello, Leon darling!
Hello.
Good morning.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
Where are they?
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
This will do. 
Where do you eat?
Where is it?
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
How's the job coming, Bob?
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
To protect his people.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
Mitchell?
Where's Hunt now?
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
Why not?
The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
Cox!  Fire him.
Can we get around this, Al?
Lincoln used it.
I don't know anything about that.
Sir?
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
But what are we paying him for?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
What about happiness, Mother?
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
Not if I give you all the cards ...
And me? ...
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Are you tapping Kissinger?
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
You're fucking me.
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
Where'd you find him?
She's quite pretty.
By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
There's no other choice.
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Did you cry when he died?
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
It was illegal, what he did.
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
... Use his women.
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
So I'm supposed to be ...
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
No, sir ...
It makes us human ...
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
Then I'll be there for you.
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
Don't be ridiculous!
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
How's that?
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
Yes, you've circled round.
How come're you doin that?
I'm... discouraged.
No ID in her room?
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
Try "old" on for size.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
Would you tell me if you had?
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
Yes Noreen you better had. Thank you.
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Yessir.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
I ain't got the money.
Not like that. Not like you say.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Just keep it up.
Yeah.
What're you doin', baby?
Why all the way to Del Rio?
You should be used to that.
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
Why would I let you do that?
Yes I did.
I can't say.
Where does he work?
...Where's the transponder?
...You getting anything on this?
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
Sir?
You stand to win everything. Call it.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Somethin' like that.
That's twenty-six dollars.
It's all right.
I want you to take me to another motel.
November the 28th, last year.
I been immobile.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Yes.
What did I say?
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
Yes sir.
How is she?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
You should get the order you want.
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
Anyway, so what?
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
"Banners?"
You must be joking.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
What?
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
No, Del.
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
I don't think your friend likes me.
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Make sure it's elevated...
What're you doing here, Roy?
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
Dr. David Ravell.
Worse.
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
No, that's not, I couldn't...
I got this apartment with a guy.
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
The Five?
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
God, that's awful!
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
Does he know you think he's real?
He is real.
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
No, almost never.
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Where are you going?
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
If we're for real?
Could you give us an example?
No...
I... I don't know...
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
I hope you're right...
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
That was a really shitty thing to do.
Well... I think I saw her soul.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
Wesley...
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
I see.  May I?
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
Seems like a nice place.
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
You lie, motherfucker...
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
Vernon Waldrip.
Now Penny, stop that!
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
- in the gods - Huh?
Well, I'm sorry honey -
Well, we need that ring.
That don't make no sense!
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
It was a moment a weakness!
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
Pete... I do apologize.
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
Yeah, I know.
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
I never said any of that!
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
I want your D.O.R.
I'm doing okay, sir.
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
Before that.
No, sir.
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
I'm a little late, that's all.
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
God help you, Lynette!
Really?
Not me.
There's always a choice.
I'll get it if you want.
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
No. Is that what you want?
Twenty-two years ago.
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
Not that one.
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
Where did you get this clown?
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
Shut up.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
Hey.
Somebody called you?
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
Watch your mouth.
How many more do we have after this?
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
What?
Ever read any Poe?
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
What do they want?
What am I, a five year old?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
What, what, what is it?!
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
What?
Huh uh.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
What are you doing with the gun?
Lemme see that rifle son...
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
Like?
Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
What are you crazy?
Yeah, it's me.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
Can you make a deal with them?
One: "We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community." Two: "We want full employment for our people." Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations...
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
So talk...
I don't know.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
Just a kid.
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
Nothing.
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
When?
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.
You call that a compliment?
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
You got salt last week.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
You're surrendering.
Yes, sir.
What unit?
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Very well, let us move on to...
Their names, ranks and posts?
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
If I fail, you fail.
How can we end this madness?
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
The middle colonies?
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
No...
Granted.  Where are you going?
Cheraw Falls.
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
That's right.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
Please.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
And your principles?
One of yours?
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
We saw.
Don't touch him.
How many men have we seen die?
Goodbye, Francis.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Thank you.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
Don't worry.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
Remember Braddock?
Put those away.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
Well...I guess not.
It's gorgeous!
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Please hurry.
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
You believe in it.
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
Hey--they actually found the place!
Nice.
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
Leave me alone!
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
Man overboard!
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
That was before I met one, of course.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
You threatened Miss Swann.
Who makes all these?
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
On what?
Do you have any idea where you're going?
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
As you can see I am a new man, just like you.
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Considering what?
Yeah?  So what?
You better quit pushing me, pal.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
A man?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Like Crazy Glue?
Daniel...
When did you...?
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
They did it to me!
What do these replicators do to people?
Just giving credit where credit is due.
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
What's that?
Who is he?
Argon's private lab.
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Icky!
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
For what?
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Your house?
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
That's an excellent idea.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Yeah?
It has been alleged - yes
Is that so?
And live on your salary, I suppose?
Who are you?
Thank you, sir.
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
I beg your pardon, sir?
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Staring at us?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Yeah?
What did he want?
Now don't be absurd, Smith  May I come in?
Thanks. May I sit down?
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Stop calling me Mother!
Yes - the worm!
Yes, sir.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
What is that?
How was your day?
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
... Lover's Lane.
What are you doing?
What's the matter?
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
I think I've got something to say.
Dan! Arrest them!
What's outside of Pleasantville?
"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
Mr. Simpson ...
Yes.
No, not that hedge. The other one.
The other one?
What are you doing?
Yeah. Every episode ever.
What did you do?
I don't believe this.
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
No way.
He won't notice anyway.
Jen please ...
I just don't think we have the right to ...
Me too. Sounds swell.
... Yeah.
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Right here.
No. I baked them for you.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
You're gonna forget about me.
I like calling you David.
Yeah ... Sort of ...
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
What the hell's going on!
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
Re-runs?
Look ...
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
Just gimme the damn remote!
Have you cooked the burgers?
Yes.
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
... What's that?
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
Dream come true, hunh?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
No, no, no.
Hello.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Please don't.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
I know.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
Yeah I can't.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I don't know.
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
Yeah I can't.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
You have a girlfriend?
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
-- you said you did.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
This is not cool.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
Thank you.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
Yeah, not really.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
....Hi.....
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
What happened?
Nothing.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Yes? I'm trying.
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
This is Barry.
I'll see you later.
Yeah?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
That's right you travel so much.
I forgot about that.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
Why?
You're hand is bleeding.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
......and this is confidential?
And your Social Security number.
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
Fine, thank you.
No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
You ok?
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
....now: this pudding?
I need to talk to you for a second.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Is this where you live?
You have another house somewhere or something?
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
What is this, man?
Are you serious with this?
Seriously.
I'll see you there.
Don't puss out.
Ok.
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
Nothing.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
Ow!
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
What? What've I done?
I must grant him his last rites.
It's not even noon --
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
Enough to discern its tenor.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
If you only mean to dupe me again --
Good day, Marquis.
His rug.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
Go to hell!
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
He'll do no such thing.
As you say, Doctor.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
Here it is; the last chapter.
At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
"A habitu of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
...yes, I've got that bit...
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
Do you?
There's no call for that language-
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
How bad is it?
How much?
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
There's a different between want and
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
Why did we not know about this sooner?
Sir, I-
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
I wanna see the picture today
I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
We find the man and then we dissect him-
Manolete?!
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Oh for Christ's sake-
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
Fuck you
I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
It doesn't have to be
Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
Hedy Lamarr?
What does this have to do with--?
Mank!
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
They've all seen a rough cut
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
It's just that my movie is so-
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
It was fun, wasn't it?
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Orson, you wanna take five?
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
You're a good sport, lady.
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
What do you mean, "you"?
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
But you said "you."
Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
At night?
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
I like the gym smell.
Now, touch me...  ...here.
I was just...
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
You asleep?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
What's the matter with you?
I am answering...
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
Then what?
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
C'mon, Tommy --
Never felt better.
He should.
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
This is Doyle's house.
This is the baby sitter.
Oh. When are they expected home?
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
She never left the apartment --
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
Give him evidence.
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
For getting rid of that cast.
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
With that cast on -- you don't.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Who are you?
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
I don't want to.
I'm not ready for marriage.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Mrs. Thorwald?
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
I wonder.
Would four of them -- ?
One hundred and twenty-seven.
You haven't even heard from him?
It is something really important, Jeff?
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Nothing, thank heaven.
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
There's nothing to see.
Still -- those witnesses.
We have all -- what?
I hate funny exit lines.
Is he cleaning house?
L. B. Jefferies.
A new disease.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
Meaning me?
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
Hang loose.  We got all night.
Yeah!
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
No.  I don't think so--
What?
You scared?
What?
How'd you get here?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Who's that!
It's me!
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
Who?
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
Why?
I'm sorry.
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
No.
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
Chicken?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
See?
"Life is crushing in on me."
You going there?
Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
Hi.
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
What makes you think he hates you, Judy?
That one?
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
Good evening.
Gabriel -- !
Gabriel, let him go --
Read a lot about you, Nick.
-- till he fucked his parole --
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
We sell children's toys --
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Beauty and fragrances.
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
You sold him out.
Your pen palls dead, lady.
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
...maybe I die for Nick...
Gabriel!
Jack. Jack Bangs.
I thought we'd have a few more days.
They've never done a robbery?
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
Get your own room, Ashley.
Nick...
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
No, you can't --
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
What'd they call her in high school?
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
The hell you don't.
What?
You got one hour.
No way.
Take 'em.
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
What?
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Five years. Since it opened.
Merlin, I didn't know --
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Hot chocolate.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
Yeah.
I'm just talking.
She's using a new perfume.
Thought you hate your old man.
Tell her... I'll be there ...
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
Tell Ashley... I...
...for Christmas...
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
The motherfucker killed Vic.
Daddy, did ya see that?
What?
We can work this out, can't we?
What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
What about?
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
Give me this fucking thing.
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
Mr. Pink.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
What's this guy's problem?
Follow you where?
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
C'mon, throw in a buck.
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
For all I know, you're the rat.
He ain't dead.
So what is it?
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
Like what?
They're stragglin'.
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
I'll make the soap myself.
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
Tell me, darling.
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
Thanks for taking over.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
Finished, son?
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
I don't care.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
Goodbye and thanks.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
And we're running out of that.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
Everybody knows --
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Good night, Miss Wells.
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
Alex, what are you doing?
Do I know you?
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
Cindy, what's going on?
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
No, stay.
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Buddy...
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Feel that?
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Listen to me I --
Oh.
Did you do that?
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Got a problem with that?
Saw who?!
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
Right. What about condoms?
Professor!
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
The image there.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
What?
You do.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
How is she?
No thanks.
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
Sorry, ma'am.
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Because it's the rules!
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
Detectives, what is this about?
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
You've been working in that video shop too long.
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
MOTHERFUCKER!!
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
That's like your car, Beverly,
...Browsing.
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
You forgot something...
What was that?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
How much does she want?
She could use a hundred dollars.
Why?
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Please - I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
I don't know.
She'll have to know some time.
No!
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
And then?
I have been at the library.
Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
It's not a searchlight  it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince - not stars --
Jason, my pet 
Because there was another girl years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
I'd forgotten.
Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish  to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
Perhaps.
But you would like to know where she is?
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
What?
Yes?
No. Why?
You play an instrument?
Oh, uh-huh.
You mean like "time flies"?
What's the first?
No.
I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
Yes.
Yes.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
I know.
What will you do when the money runs out?
Sometimes. Afterward.
Yes.
About me?
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
And now you can?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
I'm babbling.
I'm not in love with you.
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
I want to know why you are the way you are!
I want to touch you.
Graham...
Well, are you?
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
I'm not either!!
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
Loud.
Why?
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
Yeah, I know.
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
God, no.
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
What do you mean? I don't understand.
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
What!?
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
You are in trouble.
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
I don't want to discuss it.
What do you get?
About what?
How do we start?
Yes.
No.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
Were you disappointed?
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
Maybe.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Who?
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
You were prying before?
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
I like having the car, the car is important.
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
Yeah.
He'll be really mad.
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
No. I don't think so.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Didn't seem worried about them.
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
Well, at least you still talk the same.
So who changes?
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
I don't get it.
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
Huh?
NIGHT NIGHT
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY
What?
When do I get to see Brad?
But...how?
In a way...
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
I'll leave you young things to it.
I don't want to get up there.
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
It's...
You're practically naked!
I'm sorry, Officer.
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
YOUNG BLOOD
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
Flavors!
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
Gary.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
What happened to you guys?
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
Oh yeah. Much better.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Let me call Christine.
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
You know that chick?
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Beautiful.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
With Maya?
You should call her.
Right now.
Besides what?
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Nope.
What do you think's going on?
Huh.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
I said okay?
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
What's that?
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
We gotta go back.
So what's the plan?
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
I'm fine. You rest.
Why don't you come in?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Bathroom over there?
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Okay. See you around.
Maya.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Ken.
See you over there, Miles.
Sir, what are you doing?
It was a surprise, Mom.
You talked to Wendy?
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
Daddy.
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
I don't feel much.
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Five. The five longest.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
We won't be able to get out of there.
It's getting stronger.
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
Morgan?
Bimboo?
What's two?
Second thing this week I can't explain.
Is that him?
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
...And you had to kill him?
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
Forget it.
Where's Jake?
McKendrick's men got him.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
I just came out to say goodbye.
Are you all right?
This is a brutal land.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
I want you out of town before the hanging.
Where's the pinto going?
Women?
You haven't got any money.
Believe it.
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
I don't like that word much, Carter.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
Who did it?
Why are they doing this, Mal?
You've got a legitimate job.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
I just got to town.
It is that.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
The public decides who's on that list.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
Hair and make-up?
Even the fall from the plane.
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
When is she coming over?
I just read somewhere --
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Why?
What I do to Simone?
Yes, call me Simone.
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
Hello, Hal.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
You want me to call Security?
I'm sorry.
You do?
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
I do okay.  How about you?
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
I know.  Thank her for me.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
I know what you're up to.
What now, Sayer?
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
What do you want -- ?
It's a hotel.
What if it catches on fire?
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
The only real truth is in the work.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
--My God.
I'm going to see you again, right?
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
What?
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
...No.
--What?
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
And you know what else?
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
Someone got hurt.
What--
Stuttering Stanley!
Superstition.
Chicken blood on the crops.
Alright!
Fuck you.
Bitch.
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
How... was she "called?"
You'll be back.
Throw me one.
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
You're... limping.
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Second verse!
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
What?
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
That's not funny.
What you up to?
What the hell are we going to do?!
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
Rorschach.
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
My present?
I'll get if for you.
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Is this fun?
You have a great profile.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
See ya, Bandit.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Shit! No one's here.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
I hate to say it...
Never mind. It's nothing.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Talk to me.
You're coming up to the scale house.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
Bandit two, you read me?
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
That's correct.
Is your security team armed?
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
How bad?
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
Are you on a land line?
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
What'd you say?
Do you want me to say I did it?
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
FUCK YOU!
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
It's the last place they'd look.
Where's Israel?
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
...When did you know all this?
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
Shoot.
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
In the lab.  With her, probably.
Listen --
Why would you let her to do that?
You fucking bastard...
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
My wife.
Kelvin, you awake?
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
Perhaps it did.
They come when you sleep.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
Jesus...
I need to see Snow.
What are they?
I wasn't.
Stop it.
How old were you?
What happened to us, exactly?
You don't love me.
That won't happen again.  We're different.
Rheya --
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Thank you.
Chris --
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
Yes, you are --
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  And us?  We would have to have "an arrangement".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?
Why do you say that?
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
Gibarian was under enormous --
You want it coming back with us?
Uh...
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Are you nervous?
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Didn't do very well, did you?
But "nice".
You asked.
You put me life in danger.
Let go!
I don't know you...
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
Say goodbye, Mike.
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
My ass is falling.  It is.
I can still use a gun.
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Mike, take it easy...
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
What was that?
You heard me.
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
Ellie...
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
Yes.
No, sir...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
You're here 'til what time?
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
Nice threads Dad.
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
And Flash isn't?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Would you cool it already?
Frmpph-yrr.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
I hate people with alliterative names.
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Peter?
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
It's Friday night...
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
They never caught on.
Is you all little Adolfs?
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
What's the match gag?
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
You make my mouth water.
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
Break it off!
How much more do we have to take from him?
My legs are frozen.
105-353.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Then droppen Sie dead!
Shut up, Animal!
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
Grable, not Gable!
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
You're crying, Animal.
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
Not yet.
What are you going to do?
What about Schulz?
We've all done a poor job of it.
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
Anybody call?
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
What did you say?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
What time?
The what?
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
Is it all right if we smell it?
Have a nice time over there?
He is.
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
Is she still angry?
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
What happened to you?
This is the Nexus?
Left behind?
Where is he now?
These are my children...my children.
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
I thought you might.
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
Captain, are you all right?
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
The thought had crossed my mind.
It looks like we're too late.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Tractor beam, aye!
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
David!... What went wrong?
I'll handle that later.
My readings indicate great instability.
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
I don't understand.
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
Good shooting, Scotty.
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
I know you... Do I not?
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
I think it's an energy form, sir...
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Close... There --
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
Wait! Give me a chance --
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
Yes...
He asked you not to grieve...
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
Bones!...
What you ask is difficult.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
I ordered no interruptions.
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
That's all you have to say?
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
Now that's what I call a meal.
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
You did this -- in a day?!
Jim --
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
I don't mean to intrude.
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
Is that what you came here to say?
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Tactical!
Yours... is... the superior...
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
Aye, sir.
Scotty -- what's left?
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
... No response, sir.
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
It literally is Genesis...
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
They knew just where to hit us.
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
Any suggestions, Admiral?
And why not?
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
That was a little joke.
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
Time!
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Admiral on the bridge --
Prepare for warp speed.
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
I do this because I was there,
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
It'll come back to him.
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
-- That's the general idea.
What did you say she was getting?
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
... It gives me a great sense of history.
My name?
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
"Neutralized?" How?
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
You're upset about losing the whales.
What's what?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
Permission granted.
Explain.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
But you said toxic.
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
Yes.
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
Spock...
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
Bearing!
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Admiral! There be whales here!
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Just use the keyboard...
Transparent aluminum?
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
Why not...?
Are they in any danger?
Hello, Data...
From the mission...
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
A ship,
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
Understood.
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
Will that stop the tear?
How long 'til they reach us?
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
No, sir...
Say the greeting again...
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
Why was Data assigned?
Why would we be involved with these people?
You haven't done that in a long time...
What you're doing to my neck...
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
... I believe you...
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
Exactly as the simulations predicted...
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
I do not know what you are referring to.
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Juice?
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Ready to make a little history?
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Yes.
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
I can try.
What makes you say that?
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
Friends from Cornell...
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Life signs?
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
Unless you'd like to stay.
What the hell is happening, Worf?
They're bypassing Engineering...
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
I believe the operation is over.
Or not to be -
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Barely.
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
He just tried to save him!
You were demoted...
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Your friends are late...
And your coat.
How did you know...?
I know how to get outside the shield.
Possibly.
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
Sir?
Sulu!
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
Praxis?
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
- could take weeks, sir.
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
When was he... created?
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
Not tonight, I have work here.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
It'll only work for one of us.
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
Of you?
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. Id say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
What is our approximate distance?
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
What programs were accessed?
Sir?
New Praetor?
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
Wont do what, Mister Worf?
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
We're being hailed.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
It's working.
Sir?
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
It's not quite the face you remember.
You don't trust me.
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
Yes.
All of this so you could capture me?
Why are you here?
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
Please.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
He's a very unusual android.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
But surely...
Praetor.
What do you think of America?
Elmo's...
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
What?
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
Please...
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
Shit.
Shit?
What?
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
Go?
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
I understand.
You liked my singing?
You can have one.
Are you angry at me?
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
I must meet my ship.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
Oh, you're pretty...
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
Tell the baby about me.
Help me!!!
I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
Doesn't make sense.
Tell him I'm not here.
Can you see under the faceplate?
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
You married, Major?
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
I don't understand.
Is there a reward in this?
You saw that?
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Yeah, that's right.
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
Fuck you.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
I understand.  No, I'm not.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
So've I.  Too much.
Top ten.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
Looks like she was holding out.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
I won't say anything.
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
So there never was a death squad.
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Nero.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
Fumitsu.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
And gives it to you.
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
What is it?
Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Those two guys were cops.
You sure?
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
Who's Strickland?
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
Take it to him.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
Was this him?
Um... he was older.
Testa?
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
What?
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
Jesus.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
Look...
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
How did you know he was a construction worker?
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
From the grave?
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
"Was?"
How long ago?
I understand.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
The other reason?
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
What's that?
He thinks he looks young.
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
I know.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
But why this pattern?
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Yes.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
No.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
...maybe...
I'm Mike.
Like the quiche?
Why? You're not a real man?
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
He's so sweet. He really said that?
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
...It's really getting late.
Are you on the other line?
There's the rub.
It's a gig.
It's definitely a step back for me.
What do you want? You're tall.
I don't talk about her that much.
Oh no?
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
Darwinism at its best.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
Him?
There are so many beautiful women here.
I got to at least try once.
They turned you down?
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
How's it going for you two?
Not well.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hello?
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
I don't know...
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
When?
I'm not going to Vegas.
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
You gotta do it.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
She smiled, baby.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
You think so?
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
What?
She didn't like me, anyway.
Yeah, a good friend.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
What time's this party tonight?
It's on.
Which one?
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
It's not like that...
Bitch... You little bitch!
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
...you're money...
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
...Anaheim...
An eye for an eye!
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
What's the matter, Carlo?
Ba Fa Goulle.
You heard about your father?
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
I'll think about it.
You take care of your family?
Is it necessary?
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
Godfather, you understand everything.
Things went badly in Palermo?
I know about what you mean!
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me.
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
What about McCluskey?
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Did he give you his politicians?
They're waiting to see my father.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Michael, I love you.
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
How is your father?
I LOVE YOU.
Don't you want dinner first?
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
I can help you out...
What?
Where are you going?
Cut it out.
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
Do you renounce Satan.
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
You think I scam?
Sure. Any time.
He's drowning me!
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Who is it?
What about Christmas?
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
I think it might hurt her to know.
Tom.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
That ring's so great. The green one.
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
Dickie!
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Is he really not here?
Dickie did it.
Where does Dickie live?
I told you. He gave them to me.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Excuse me?
Randall.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
So -- are you travelling under R?
You know what -- I am.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
I can't later.
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
We'll be there.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
I'm fine.
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
31 people.
It is a little coarse, yes.
I have!
Yes?
I can believe that.
Where do you live?
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
Really?
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
The DMZ?
That would have been quite a coincidence.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
I'm leaving.
Huh?
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Oh, Tom, please.
What taxi driver?
What is your name? My name is Travis.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
One-Ball McCall?
Stick up?
I don't like my real name.
No.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
I musta been stoned.
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
I can leave anytime I want.
But that one night?
That's not hard to do.
Huh?
I... I don't get along with people like that.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
Why should it be grounded?
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Some. Here and there.
Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
Who?
Oh?
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
O.K., cowboy.
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
Yeah.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
It's me sir.
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
Surprise, surprise.
God's speed.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
You'll stand by me?
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
How'd it go?
... including me.  Right?  
I'm sorry.
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
But what?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
And... what's my name again?
We've been closed for a while.
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball."
I'm here.
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
Jesus.
What's his rent?
Huh?
Yeah, well, that's enough.
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.
Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
The war...
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Would you like some brandy?
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
San Francisco.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
Different?
Then why did she object to you?
I don't understand.
Do you think I should go?
Is anyone there?
Mom, they're in a cage!
They haven't harmed anyone.
Miss Daniels?
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
Don't you like us?
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
I don't know, honey.
What?
The little Brenner girl.
Yep.
Yes, but where?
See where I'm pointing?
Yes?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Of course.
What name?
Daniels.
The little Brenner girl?
Are you sure?
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
When do you think they'll come?
That's a chance we have to take.
Maybe we ought to leave.
They won't be.
If they are?
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
What?
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
I understand completely, sir.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
What did you say?
We met in court.
What's that?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Oh, no you don't!
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
Certainly, but...
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
What did it say?
Do you expect me to believe...?
What do you want ?
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
You have a job?
I have several jobs.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
What do you mean?
I think it's safe to get out now.
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
Hello, Miss Daniels.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
Birds?
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
I haven't finished my drink.
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
Aye.
I don't think I can go on, sir.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
Don't call me that confounded name.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
I've had some experience.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
Get out of here!
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
I have other means of sustenance.
You and I should work together.
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
You're not going to Gray.
I hate that picture.
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
You think I'm crazy.
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
You killed that cop Dutton.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
... it connects you to me...
You mean Alex.
You want me to walk a straight line?
What is it?
I think I dropped an earring.
They killed her because she found out.
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
Yes.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
What do you mean, dear?
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
How does he explain that?
You know about the United Nations?
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
I feel different right now.
Naturally I think so.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
But how -- how long--?
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
The Prince of Darkness.
We were gonna grab some food.
Hey, take it easy.
What is this, David?
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Thanks, Grandpa...
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
Good!
Whatcha doin' over here?
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
I like Michael.
Still mad at me?
Okay?
I'm tired now.
Michael!...
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
He met a girl.
Ohmygod...
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
Max!  What's wrong?
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Let's go see them.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
No.  Why?
Wanna go to the comic book store?
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
Anybody sick?
How you doin', old boy?
Cut him loose?
Torch them!!
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
When was the last time you used it?
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
Looks good.
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
Tie up Clark, too.
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
So what do you make of it?
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
MacReady...?
You hear that?
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
What?!
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
What else can they do?
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
What are you?
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
Sir... have you a name?
In for a penny, in for a pound.  Do you know that saying?
End...?
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
That was a foolish thing to do.
I don't think that's going to happen.
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
You promised me flowers.
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
Well there's something new.
All right, what is it now?
Got here as soon as I could.
Darling.
No... let's walk through the city.
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
Tonight's the night?
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
How long did you travel?
Is there a lot of illness?
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Yes!
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Here?
I see.
Imagine that.
"Eloi"?
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
Where do they take them?!
We choose to believe it.
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
We are not birds of a feather.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
You sure you know where to find one?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
My father used to talk about you.
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
No, it hasn't.
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
[Beat] What's your name?
But no one knew until after...
Do you really believe me?
I know.
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.
Then, where are you going?
I don't understand.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
Well, what time is it?
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
Who told you this?
Sure.
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
This is pretty good. Considering...
You like it?
[Beat] I do it.
This is a great song.
How?
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
Uh-huh.
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
Who's the nut?
Who do you think did it?
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
You girls are in some hot water.
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
I have no problem with that.
Oh shit.
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
What did ya do?
I'm a robber.
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Do you love me?
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Front.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Call him?
What did Darryl say?
She thinks he's a pig.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
What for?
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Louise?  Where are we?
Just past Boise City.
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
This is so beautiful.
You know why.  You already said.
I said all that?
Louise?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
You awake?
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
Now what?
Go.
Hi!
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Never?
I mean since then.
I don't know.
Well why don't you look her up?
Yeah, right.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
And you think he could find out her number for me?
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Shoot.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
You know, clean the pipes.
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
We're in love with your roommate.
Stalker, huh?
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Am I?
Who the fuck is it to you?
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
What's that?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
So...
All set.
All you want is a phone number?
No.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
No, not at all.
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
Four kids, three different guys.
Oh my.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
You bet.
What do you mean?
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
Good lookin'?
What's he like?
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Bundt cake?
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
Not long at all, but I really like him.  Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
What...?
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Sure.
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Go!
I, uh... I got it stuck.
It.
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
Starshells.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
Yeah.
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
John. How much time?
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
How long until the army is ready?
Hey, sport. You winning?
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
I don't like what's happening.
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
What's that?
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Bastards...
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
What did he say?
The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
What the hell do you want me to do?!
What?
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
You're the Indian FBI.
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
I read, Cooch.
Good.
Do you want a coffee?
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
I'll bet!
How so?
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
There you go with those moves again.
Evan... or Maverick.
Harmless!
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
It dies. We live.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
Anything.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
Not to me.
What do you want?
What kind of games?
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
Want to play the game?
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
Let's hope you're right!
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
Ohhh Mother!
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
You ever done this before?
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
Need a hint?
So have I.
Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
Then why are you here?
I don't know...
You may not think so, but you are.
What happened to number five?
Fuck you.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
I'm with an very important client.
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
HER!
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
Where's Kuato?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Harry, what the hell is this?
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Where?
I want that fucker dead.
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Level 2.  Galleria.
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
I've got a weak signal over there.
Mmmm.....
Lori...
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
Just think about it.
Lori, move.
What are you doing?
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
Clever girl.
I love you.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
What's in the two week package?
All right.
Go on.
What's he talking about?
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
What are you talking about?
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
He's lying.
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
You guys all set?
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Cannon fuse.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
So...now what?
You're gonna get us hung up.
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Why?
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
Its tires are flat...
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
Ready?
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
I brought it... to the coroner.
He was your snitch.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
I noticed.
Look, I'm a lawyer and --
"We"?
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
I can describe it.
Where?
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
Eddie... What's a DD-5?
They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
-- What?
...What do you mean?
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
What's Art Esparza?
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
...For ten years, now.
Stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward, Kitty. Y'oughta start looking for the others...
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
The Joe Boys in 1980...!
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
About Chinatown. What went down.
Back in the Seventies I spent years putting away gangsters in a Colombian syndicate called "the Ochoa". These guys are very dangerous, Ed. When I hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys, I see red.
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
I don't think I know that name.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
No.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Let's ditch this place and party.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Phillip?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Lil was wearing a sour face.
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
Noooo...
Oh god, Laura.
Well, why not?
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Call me.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
Where are the Cookies?
Laura, I am your friend.
You're not mad at me?
I can't help you there.
What'll it be?
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
Hey, Jacques...
Right on time, baby.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
I've got to see you.
Not now.
I can't tonight.
No.
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
Laura.
What were you doing in my room?
I hate asparagus.
Good night, Mom.
A friend from school.
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
I don't know.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
We thought it was just.
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
It looks that way.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
I... yes.
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
Neurology?
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Mr. Concannon...?
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
What is this going to cost?
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
Yes.
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I need an extension for my case.
Overruled...
I changed my life today. What did you do?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
What happened...?
I've got to work...
And it's over...?
Yes.
I... do you want me to leave?
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
No... no...
Thank you.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
And ask me what?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
Yeah.
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Mick. Mick. Mick...
...I have to stand up for her...
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
What happened, Joey...?
I'm swell.
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
In New York?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
Hey, how about that!
Hey, there - open up!
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
So is the town, I notice!
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
What'll we say to 'em?
One of mom's cups got broken.
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
Just be careful, okay?
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
I want my kid out of here now!
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
You okay, champ?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
When do you think it'll be done?
You're not crazy, by the way.
Is Chase Porter your husband?
Studio B.
The car's no there yet?
Heather, what is it?
Yes?
Coffee'd be nice.
I can take it.
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
Yes sir.
Make us proud.
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
What was that?
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
Can we talk?
We all have problems.
You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
Do you have your ticket?
Good.
So... What happened?
How do you know?  They might.
It was so real...
That's how he died you know.
Jesus, you never told them?
Yes, sir.
Well, spit it out.
Of what?
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
Is that what you were trained to do?
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
We'll think of something.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Do you have something to say?
I'm not gonna kill it.
I can't be sure.
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
And you didn't do anything about it?
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
What is it?
Nice of you to drop by.
Told ya I would. You still riled?
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
What is it, Johnnie?
That bastard Pucinski...
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
You ain't actin', mama.
And?
Why, honey?
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
You okay, honey?
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
That don't seem fair.
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
You got me, peanut.
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
What was this one?
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
More'n likely.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Under a hundred.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
Yeah, I'm here.
That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
There's worse places, honey.
Trust me on it.
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
Yeah?
Anything I can do for you?
It's okay by me, peanut.
You been drinkin', huh?
What?
Mama???
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Course I am, mama.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
Explain it... I told you.
In the head.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Through the forehead?
You got nice tits.
Someone's gonna see us.
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
Whattya mean?
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
That's just how my brain works, I guess.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
He said something about being between things.
She left me. Crabs.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
Is that just beer?
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
You stay there.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
What's to tell?
Is he awake?
Want some help with that?
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
I've been trying to finish a book...
I know.
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Sure.
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
With Emily?
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
So what are you doing out here?
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
They're glass. The buttons.
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
Miss Sloviak's.
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
Blocked.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
Maybe...
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
Kinship. And what's here?
The one that left you?
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
What?
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
I eat.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
So what are you going to do?
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
He cribbed that from Borges.
Professor Tripp.
Emily left me this morning.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Not have it.
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
Really? That was fast.
I'm kidding. Hello?
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
I think I might have.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
I guess you have to go on faith.
Did you just make that up?
The more the merrier.
That's a nice greenhouse.
Listen, Antonia --
This is important.
What is it, Grady?
What made you pull out that old thing?
Where you stand?
I was just thinking of... the noise.
When can I see her?
It was a beautiful present.
No thanks.
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
Nothing.
What are you looking at?
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
I think you do.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
I don't know.
You knew her?
You don't know?
I wasn't feeling well.
He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well.
You're a cop. Figure it out.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
I count my blessings.
So. How are you adjusting?
I know because... it's just something I know.
It's getting dark. Go home.
The job's okay.
That's right.
No way.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Ev-i-dence.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
I'm still thinking about it.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
I don't feel anything.
We have a few more minutes.
I mean, when will I be normal.
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
I don't know.
And what are you doing?
This is garbage!
You felt pleasure.
What about bears?
What about them?
Something happened to you.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
How about in the morning.
What for?
So, what did you do?
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
I've changed.
All three -- in chronological order.
You must hate your brothers.
Neither am I.
I've got problems.
What's going on?
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
Okay so far.
You never did like being called that, did you?
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
But what did he see that made him panic?
I think it likes you.
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
Try again.
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
No, Bud, no... not you.
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Virgil?
Is that it?  Is this right?
He's convulsing!
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
Are we talkin' little space friend here?
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
Cab One, radiation readings?
How many are there?
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
But you just said that a month was too...
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?
Four or five days.
There's no comparison.
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
Does it please you to say such things?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
Have you ever been in love?
I'm not coming.
What do you mean by sensible?
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
Yes, sir. Three times.
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
But where did you come from?
And how come you're up so early?
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
They didn't seem too good.
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc.
He talked to you Himself?
I'm a blimp.
Because...
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
But she watches... she listens.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
Yes Mother.
Why?
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
It's not that... it's not that...
It's not my time of month.
Should you see a doctor?
Well, who in particular?
I love you.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Oh, yes!
Do you think he loves you?
Do you remember the night they said it came?
Something I ate.
Down... there.
Yes.
I... I don't understand.
Martha Louise Livingston.
Are you married?
Do you have any children?
I've stopped menstruating
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
What things?
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
She can.
How?
Yes?
Yes.
Alright.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Doctor Livingston.
Why were you afraid?
It grew.
Would you like to tell me?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
Hm hmm.
No.
Why isn't anyone coming?
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
Who?
She'd seen him too.
For what he made me go through.
H... how?
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
???
Look into the convent records.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
You have proof?
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
Oh that one there, in the corner.
I can beat that.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
And in your eyes?
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
She has it now.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
You hate us don't you?
The Catholic Church...
It's my affair too.
She is not a child.
Then help her.
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
When was that?
Do you know what she did to her?
And my permission?
I haven't decided yet.
Nothing...
All right?
Fine thanks...
Long, thin and filtered.
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Pipe!
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Become?  One is born a saint.
Listen to her singing.
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
Too late for what?
The scandal...
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
They're yours.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
How about Ding Dong?
What about all these letters?
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
Me? Why?
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
I beg your pardon?
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
It is, y'know.
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
Sure. .
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Oh, there you are!
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Are you supposed to be here?
Is it ... is it, really?
I'm not ...
They ought to be.
What are you?
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
... all this and a jam butty too!!
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Yes.
Books are good!
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
Oh ... I dunno.
Yeah ... that's right.
And what's it all come to in the end?
That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
What's he on about?
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
Would you two like a cup of tea?
That'll keep you busy.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Is that yours?
What little old man?
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!  Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
What's he know?
Ah, go on, you swine.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Aye, but you know him well.
What have you heard?
It'll only get you into trouble.
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Eh, where's my grandfather?
None for me, then?
But...
Yeah, you want to watch it.
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
How's that?
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
Where the hell are we?
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
Hard to say.
You know what they make this stuff out of?
Where does that go?
Dead!
That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
It's really on there tight.
What?
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
Yes.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
Can you get them back?
Recognizable!  In that?
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
No, it's coming.
It won't come -- it's stuck.
Yes, thank heaven.
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
They're on the next level up.
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
Yeah?
Oh my God.
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
This ship is full of cat hair.
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
Kill me...
What can I do?
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
It's a rhino.
Thanks.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Listen to what?
Something spooking the rhinos?
One of 'em must have escaped.
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
And...?
They've changed their heading again.
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
Four.
What is that?
Seltzer?
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Think I spoke too soon...
Jesus.
You should hit the sack, too.
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
Eddie...
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
Hungry?
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
Just like that, eh?
It wasn't meant to be.
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
Margo.
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
How nice.
Where?
Right here. A minute ago.
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
I love you...
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
When I'm guest of honor?
That never stopped you before.
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
The kid. Junior.
Don't mix your metaphors.
Okay. Mix.
What a body, what a voice.
Now don't get carried away-
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
It's not nonsense.
Thanks for your help... good luck.
Is that what you want me to be?
Everything.
- and for you.
You hear all kinds of things.
Lemme fix you a drink.
Oh, brother.
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
Oh-oh.
Do you want an argument or an answer?
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
It was for my report.
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
You won't forget it?
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
The curtains. I made them myself.
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Hi.  Hello, darling-
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
Three or four miles...
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
About what?
How was the concert?
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
Now just a minute-
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
Would you, really? How sweet-
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
Margo, you haven't got any age.
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
I never said it was!
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
I don't think I could be.
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
But what could she do?
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
Answer my question!
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
Republican?
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
11:30.
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
But you know who did.
None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
On the orders of Haldeman?
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
Who were they?
Who by?
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
Right.
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
They are not my clients.
...you're definitely doing a story...?
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Mitchell knew then.
Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
There were more then.
Howard Hunt here.
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
It is.
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
This is your plan, Finch?
Charming.
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
What?!
Stifler told me.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
So we're gonna be close next year?
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
Give it to me!  Yes!
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
There's our man.
Pontificated.
But, but -- what would I do?
Yeah, sure.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
Who cares?
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
What's up, fellas?
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
So you need to change, right?
Well...uh...
Nadia, I can't --
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
That's my trick!
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Our last game is this Saturday.
Really?
Merde! I can't believe this!
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
Hello?
What?
Whoa...
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Encul d'Americain.
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Before the coma!
What's the problem?
Yeah?
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
Why would he pick this one?
Shit. I feel sick.
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Enough. Cut him loose.
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
I have to go now, before it gets light.
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Yes, your highness.
Yes, your highness.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
I'm going to stretch my legs
Sad?
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
I'm so scared...
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
What?
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
See? The Princess is under there ...
How is our current financial status?
What's your name?
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
You don't want my autograph.
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
I-you know, I don't wanna.
What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Hi. Hi, hi.
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Me? Oh, downtown!
All right.
Yeah, my grammy.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Sylvia Plath.
M'hm...
Duane?
Oh, I see, I see.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
No, so help me.
As Balzac said...
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
Here, you want some?
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
Hey?
M'hm.
M'hm.
And blind people, crippled...
M'hm.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Well, have you ever made love high?
It relaxes me.
M'hm.
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
Are yuh?
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
M'm.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
What's- It's me, open up.
Yeah.
Okay, let me have this.
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Oh, I had the radio on.
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
Yeah, but it's real close.
Happy birthday.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
What thing?
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
This is my room.
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
Bad?
Where are you going?
You catch Dylan?
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Just give me the license, please.
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Ah.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Well, sit down.
I don't know, I mean, I-
M'hm.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
M'mmm.
Yeah.
Oh, gosh.
We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
Oh.
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
Very well.
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
You're fucking desperate.
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
What?
Why didn't you bring him?
Why would she care?
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
I'm the hired help.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
And you know our friends, how?
Cal, my wife Judy.
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
A perfect night.
Hey!  Would you?
It was fifteen seconds.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
He's directing now.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
No luck.
What?
No.  Did you?
Don't get it.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
Dolphins.  Great.
Don't be so sure.
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
Panes!  How are you?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Yes, she is.
No.
Don't be silly.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Something soft.
Sally did all this herself?
I'm a little nervous, so...
Lemon or raspberry?
Medallions.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
I didn't say a word.
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
They're nothing like us.
Excuse me?
Yes.
Do you need anything else?
I was impressed.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Would you, like, marry him?
Very.
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
It's much more personal in here.
A notch above the storage room.
So how much do you hate her?
And the food sucks, I know.
Well good.  Thank God.
What do you mean, thank God?
Not nice.  Not kind.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
You did?
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
...Ants...
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
What did you do to your hair?
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
Marry Christmas.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
I forgive you.
One more?
Three.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
I don't understand --
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
Here. How about some breakfast?
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
Baxter.
No -- it's my stomach.
I'm not very good at it.
Give what up?
A bad insurance risk?
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
Why not?
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
There's a call for you --
No, I don't.
Here.
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
I guess so.
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
Baxter?
That's right, Baxter.
What kind of joint are you running?
Sir?
Who?
Are you going to deny it?
Where is your apartment?
How do you work it with the key?
Where are you going, Baxter?
How would you like to go tonight?
Oh, you don't have to worry --
So it was.  She threw it at me.
I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
I see.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
No, no -- just had a little accident.
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
How do you spell her last name?
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
Well, I have things to do --
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Good night?
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
A.W.O.L.?
Dreyfuss.
Yes, I know.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
You didn't really believe me, did you?
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
Stop that, Fran.
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
Go where?
Yeah --
I said I like all of them.
Part.
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
So what happened ?
Arch light.
How?
Charlie?
Looks that way.
Not a thing.
... he's an amazing officer.
Smoke !
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning.
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Signs?
Anybody see some smoke ?
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
I only met Kurtz once.
Yeah, it still runs.
Charlie?
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
This gentleman or myself ?
A lame ?
About what ?
What, sir?
The wind --
Change.
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
Who knows.
Don't you agree?
Music?
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
Yeah, I like it...
Did you know him very well?
No -- no, Captain.
What's this tiger shit?
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.
Why?
You're Australian?
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --
You talk about ecology -- there it is.
212  CONTINUED:
How long have you been up north?
Six months.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
It's exactly what you meant.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
A daughter in Oregon.
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
Forget it.  It would take days.
Have to get these wet things off.
Stay still.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.
Can you walk?
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Why the smirk?
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
Go easy.
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
How old are you?
Oh, please...
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
I can't. I work.
I was going to do that for you.
Hey -- you let him...
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
You don't owe me that.
I'll take you... why not?
I should've danced with you.
Were you asleep?
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
You know what? I...
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
One night with me!
No. No. Get Carol.
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Good evening.
Is he dead yet?
Absolutely.
Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
How're you doing?
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Go away.
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Would you leave now, please?
Thanks.
I think you gotta camp it here...
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Just a second -- he has to go.
So you're from around here?
Why?  What happened?
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
You can't --
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
Bain.  Michael Bain.
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Game over, bitch!
I'm on the scent.
Michael?
Who?
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
Okay.  How did you find me?
Who is that other guy?
So this is something between you and him?
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
Rath.  Robert Rath.
Yeah.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
How did you get into the business?
The C.I.A.?
How old were you?
Ahhhh...
Are they usually like that?
Did it ever bother you?
About?
Oh.  What do you think about?
Not even a stalemate?
No.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
Do you think he's here?
Here?
Sorry.
Two way?
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
Except --
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
What did he want?
Ten years later, here you are again.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Thank you.
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
And you were drilling these holes...?
Can I ask you something?
Yes.
Why?
Did you --
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
No.
Why?
You're very good at this aren't you?
Then, I'll sail alone.
Is that all you want?
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
How to make a buck!
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
Like Custer huh?
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
Thought of everything haven't you.
I'm an idiot?
Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.
I thought you were gonna throw these?
Like helping a sick kid?
What?
So I hear.
Damn!
WE gotta think of something.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
What are you talking about?
There shooting at something.
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
Sure. Excellent.
I could pencil you in if you like?
That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.
Will it help to get you out?
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
We don't need you.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
Run into Josh?
Where did you steal the car?
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
How do I know this isn't a trap?
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
We had a deal!
But I have to finish this....
So, he didn't fire you?
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Josh!
Come on Holly!
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
Have you lost all control of this city?
She's coming over here...
Kelly wouldn't do that.
Why not?
You saw him?
To see your father?
I could take after Dad, too.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
Don't call him a dipshit.
I'll take a chance.
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
No.
And why would that scare me?
What does that mean?!
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
Yes. But not as a date date.
Why not?
Is there a rush?
You're acting like a crazy person.
I don't understand...
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
So what do you want to see?
Are you trying to seduce me?
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
Jamie --
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
Up to?
Boys like him have -- expectations.
We didn't tell him any different for years --
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
You came here to give me my report card?
A similar triangle?
Scalene?
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
What do you want, Biff?
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
It's polyester.
Huh?
Maybe if I used my left....
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
March 11th.
What?!
The power converter...
Professor, be serious, would you?
The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Okay.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
You lost that one?
Holly.
Nah, I got me a job.
Doing what?
That's my father. I got to run.
Great.
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
Just don't... I've got a headache.
How's he doing?
Yes.
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
Really?
Just thinking.
Okay, friend. Start running.
Just gimme a chance.
Planet 10?
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Then what?
We will, old fried, we will.
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
But John Whorfin said kill her.
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
What's his problem?
It's a spittin' image.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
...Who is this?
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
What are they like? What are they about?
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
...Who?
I write.
What DID you mean?
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
And what would that be, son?
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going  don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
No, what did it say?
Go ahead, son.
...Barton, is everything okay?
That's all right, really, thank you.
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now 
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Hell, I could tell you some stories
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying  a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration 
It's okay, it's okay.
...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
Barton. Are you all right?
Why don't we go to your room-
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
Yeah.
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
Jesus, Charlie, I...
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
I'm at the Earle.
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
Yes sir.
...Those your only bags?
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
...I thought you said you were a writer.
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul  well, all right, a little bit, for the critics  but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".
Where were you tonight?
Yeah, I was drinking.
There's no smoking in this building.
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
How about the coke?
No?
What was she like?
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
You did it for me.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
What is this interest you've got in her?
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
I'm De...
Yes.
Did I miss something?
Even though you were fucking him.
Why not?
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
What was the weapon?
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Nope, can't say that I do.
What are you doing here, Pop?
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
You feeling better?
It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
Maybe the maid did it.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Fuck you, Phil.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
She's a suspect.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
What do you think?
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
What's wrong?
Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death.
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
How much for these five?
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
A primate?
I'm not black.
You're not?
Blue? Where?
Hey  Willie Mays.
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
You got a date already?
Oh man! Folklore guy  worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
So then what?
I guess it was a long time ago.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
Can I walk you home?
You do! You definitely do.
Wanna go get some breakfast?
... What's the matter?
What's wrong with me?
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but  whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
That's great.
No, I'd like the scarf.
I don't eat junk food.
You see? You have someone to live for.
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.
You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother  when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
Admiring your handiwork?
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
You almost sound enthusiastic.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
Nope, I told her everything.
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
No.  No glass on the inside.
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
Son!
Silent night, violent night...
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
Working late?  I'm touched.
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
I am as well as can be expected.
I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
It's good to see you.
What is it?
Alfred, are you...?
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
I'm afraid to ask.
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
How did you...?
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
What happened to his wife?
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
Impressive
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
Where is my wife?
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Is he all right?
The _Rolls_?
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
Perhaps the fall...
Enigma.
What now sir?
Al?
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
We all wear masks.
My life's an open book. You read?
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
Rinka.
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
You understand obsession better than you let on.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
Excuse me.
Like normal folks.
And now....
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
Okay. I'm outta here.
How could I forget?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
Paranoid? The psychotic?
A man with a death wish.
Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
Do you want a drink?
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
Maybe we should just kiss.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
What now?
We got 'em!
I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
What are you talking about?
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
How'd you know it was me?
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
Yum, yum.
Peanuts?
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ....
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
And what did you say?
Everything's gonna be fine.
Here, let me do that.
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
Yes, isn't he.
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
What?
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
What a dork. Huh huh.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Turd-burglar...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
...Two...
Talk ta me, Bork.
I see it. I don't get it.
That's better. Yes?
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
How's your arm?
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
They make gypsies look good.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
Where are your skulls and bones?
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
Three times.  Powerful number.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
Nobody else can.
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
What is going on?
Did you get the paint?
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
I think so.
I... I don't know what your name is.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
I cannot believe this.
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
You don't have a key?
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
Hellooo!  How's school?
I understand. I've seen it done before.
Yes. I think so, too.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
... And please call me Robert.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
... But he's...?
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
No. I'm a gardener.
... Why... No, I don't think so...
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Chauncey...
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
Yes. That could be true.
Yes.
I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey...  ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you...
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
Bravo!
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Yes. I like to watch.
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
... Then you really are a gardener?
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
Please, sir.
How long do we stay in here?
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
I hope so.
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
How were you paid?
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
Have you served in the Army?
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  He has one just like it.
Correct.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Yes, I will.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
... Yes, I am, Ben.
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
No, that won't do any good.
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
This is not what I requested.
Right, Chief.
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
... Well?
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Yeah, just an idea I had.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
The iguana.
I want to try.
How was it?
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
What about Maxine?
You fell in love with her first.
I'm sorry for everything.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
Schwartz.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
Emily Dickinson.
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
That's the usual?
You're a fag or a liar.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
You're late.
Let him try.
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
No.
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
A scary dream?
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
But I think I have another plan.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
Yes, my dear?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
Ah.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
I'm getting better all the time.
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
I'd love to see your work.
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
You still know.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
What you want?
Fine. But what would I do at night?
Back stiff?
You sure?
The church!
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
That's so.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
Make it the way I always do.
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
Why me, man?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
What the fuck is he talking about?
They posted the next round of the tournament--
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
Are you gonna split hairs?
I've had a--
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
Uh-huh.
Lebowski on the right?
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
No.  Here.
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
So Dieter has the money?
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
Jeffrey--
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
Hey Walter--
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
FUCK.
Wooden bridge, huh?
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
Walter--
What about the toe?
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Dude--
Yeah.
Dude?
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
Shit yeah!
What the fuck are you talking about?
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
He can't walk, Walter!
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Yeah.
There weren't any shots.
Yeah?
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
Dude.
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
You monsters!
Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Whatta we do about the Mex?
<i>You'll</i> take him.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
I'll heal.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Like cancer with a purpose.
What do you think?
Sounds like a plan.
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
What the fuck you doing?
Going somewhere?
Whistler, I --
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."
And that's a good thing?
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Is it bad?
-- tearing me -- apart.
This isn't human blood.
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
Blade --
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
How did you escape?
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
What're you doing there?
Trying to find the energy.
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
"The Voiiiiices made him do it."
Yeah, so?
--the witch kills children--
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
Why is there no "our" here?
What?
What can I get you?
Then I'm going--
Are you marked like this??
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
I don't know yet.
So lemme see it.
I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.
No fucking.
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
Too busy eating us?
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
How's she going to know where to--
--I saw what I saw.
Hold this.
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
Dad...?
Yeah.
Domini's the only logical explanation.
She's far from "fine."
No. We <u>all</u> go.
Why?
Does she, goddamnit??
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--it's urgent!
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
When you don't they're usually nice.
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...What's going on with you two?
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
...You know that car?
Then what'd you come here for?
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
I want you to go fishing.
Yeah. Is it...
...What?
...it's too damn risky.
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Okay.
The criminals are winning.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Jeffrey nothing.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Shit. You better tell me something.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
No. Come on.
Nothing. Are you alright?
No. What is happening?
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Hi. can I come in?
Nice guy.  Who's he?
Falling.
Yes.
Frank is coming?
Whatiya mean?
What do you want?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
I'll call you.
It's okay. it's okay.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
No thanks.
I don't want to go.
Go where?
What are you lookin' at?
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
Are you alright?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Oh, okay. can I call?
Look. it can wait till Sunday.
What did you see?
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
You saw a lot in one night.
Yeah?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
You worry about me really?
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
You didn't tell him about me?
What is it?
What was that all about?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
My father has a gun at home.
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
Go ahead.
Hi Dad.
uh uh.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
What?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Greetings, Mr. George.
Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Que va hacer?
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
And I only deal with you?
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
Oh hey, one more thing?
Your offense?  Why are you here?
No?
What do you got there, Diego?
Yeah, I'm out.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
George, I am happy to see you.  How are you, my brother?
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
Yeah, well...
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
What are you going to do?
Just low.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
Figured what out?
George.
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
Look what the cat dragged in.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
She did that before.
But this is...
Where are you going?
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
Hey, George.  You okay?
Yeah.
Well, here I am.  See?
You can call me Dad if you want.
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
I fucked up.
Shhhh.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
Nice weed, huh?
Smith.  Hampshire....
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Dien Bien Phu?
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
Sure. By shooting at me.
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
I think it'll be a success ...
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
But it's not even midnight yet!
What is she saying?
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
You got something on the coke?
Cause?
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
Increase his heart rate.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
Sit down, Frank.
Why would she want that?
Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Objection!
I have.
Her name?
How did he look?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Is it Marsh?
Who found him?
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
We were lovers.
What kind of condition are you referring to?
What happened next?
I had bypass surgery.
She was.
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
-- And what did you suggest?
No.
No.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
I was angry.
High school?
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
What happened next?
Yes -- he mentioned it.
Yes.
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
P.M.
Frank -- what are you doing here?
Yes.
Do you think I did it?
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
I thought the subject was sex?
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
What do you think?
It's not my taste.
Nothing.
Yeah.
What would?
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
-- But it's Sunday.
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Well, that's a long time.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
It's a beautiful picture of her.
I can't believe she's making jokes.
Well, I'd like to read them.
Did we want to?
She's changed.
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
Francesca.
Help cook?
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
Why did you stop?
Do you miss it?
My God. How I'd love to see that.
You want to go back in?
What?
So what happened?
You must get lonely at times.
Why doesn't it scare you?
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
What made you ask such a question?
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
Francesca?
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Okay. See you later.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
You want to eat something?
How about Bari?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Near the church.
Why do you say that?
Sleep all right?
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
Then he can move! People move!
What about your husband?
You feeling better Franny?
What time is it?
I'm going to miss you.
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
Are you nuts?
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
Where we'll always be...
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
Aren't you going to join us?
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
It's alright, baby.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
Are they on the radio?
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
What else does she say?
Cinn?
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
I'm here.
Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
Yeah, you heard of him?
You gotta use your imagination.
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
And some people need their medication tweaked.
That building?
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
You shouldn't have hit me.
Open the case!
I think you're fucking crazy!
The next one blows off your dick.
We know how this was done, eh?
No, Gino!
Oh, shit ...
It's not here, Caesar.
What are you doing?
Don't tell him --
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
What did she do to you?
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.
What?  How about a drink?
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
Okay, sure, Mick.
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
Who?
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
What?
What's wrong?
Shit, here we go.
Because it's the truth.
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
What the fuck was it?
What was it then?
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
What choice?
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
Then what?  Exactly.
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Why?
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
Does Johnnie hit on you?
He does it right in front of him.
What time did you say they would be there?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
How'd it go?
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
I don't think so.
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
Yes.  Is he there?
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Yes.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
What if I say no?
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
What?  Like amnesia?
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
-- you could put it together --
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
You ever think maybe you have a family?
Where?
Thanks for the ride.
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
-- forget it --
What is that?
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
xxxxxx
Who is it?
xxxxxx
I can't protect you anymore.
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
Where's the dog?
xxxxxx...
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
What?
-- he accessed the account --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
How did I get here?
You drink rum?
...Be back.
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
You sound worried.
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
What's she done?
Why?
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
And you're mine.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
Jack, she's innocent!
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
I bet you'd like to touch them?
Who are you? Let go!
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
Yes, of course. Sorry.
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Where are you taking me?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
What's going on here?
It's heavy.
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Well, terrorists of course.
Let go! We've got to stop!
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
Go away.
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
Isn't it? Whose is it?
But if they did promote you
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
I delivered it.
It's what you wanted isn't it?
What?
Hey - that's my desk!
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
How long will she he away?
Numero une, crevettes  la mayonaaise. 
What is it?
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
Put the phone down and your hands up.
Er, don't you want to search me?
Yes?
What is it?
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
Es impossible.
She wanted something to help her sleep.
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
At least he's got people around him.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
He's dead, huh?
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
She should go home.
Yes?
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
I think the worst is over.
She's no whore, Marcus.
The family know?
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
No.
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
Where you going?
Mr. Oh.
Okay, whatta I do?
Don't push it, Larry.
Mr. Oh.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
He's crazy.
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
Shut up a second...
No.  No.
Okay.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
Yes.
Eventually rising to...
Ravenous homosexual.
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
Why do you say that?
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Did you shoot their boots?
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
Yes.
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
I lost six pounds...
I'm not kidding.
What?
No.  You know that I'm not.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
Yes.
So who's the guy?
Your hair's a little funny.
Okay.
I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Jane?
They're not really going to call security are they?
I really have to go.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
I wish it were you giving the story.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
If we could just eat first.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
Uh-huh.
Whoa, this was a mistake.
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this.  You look so clean and pretty.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
Nervous?
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
Who?
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
I got promoted for things like that.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
I knew what you meant.
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
Take it easy.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't...
Are you okay?
It's kind of dark -
That doesn't look like very much clay.
I already told you I'm not.
Is the manager cooperating?
See you later -
More champagne, your majesty?
Did you hear what he said?
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Walter...there's...
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
Would you pose for me for free?
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Well I was uh, just looking...
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
You better hold off on the bubbly.
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Yeah?
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Hm.
Did you see my cat?
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
Well I'm overjoyed.
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
Are you done with these?
Maxwell.
Hi.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
I don't think this is gold.
Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
Suck!
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
Get away from here.
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
Maybe.
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
You're even weaker than the others.
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
You sure?
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
You were supposed to be here at three.
I forgot.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Just stay away from me, okay?
What, um...  What do we do?
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
What?
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
A what?
Buffy...
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
I...
Five.
I'm curious, is all.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
Interesting.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
All right.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
I don't get it.
What's happening?  What do you want?
Oh, yes!  Yes!
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
I can't believe they still ate it.
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
Cool!
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
Oh, yeah!
And the January Semi-formal --
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
No...  You want me to give him a message?
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
I know what it is.
Well I guess this is it.
Neither will I.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
See my hips?
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
Damn.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
I want to be had.
Why baseball?
Who?
It's possible.
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
Why you shaking me off?
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
I was playing naked.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Settle what?
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
No.
We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
Can I give you my testimony?
Ain't he warning up?
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
We're eight and sixteen.
It's a miracle.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Stop -
She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
No, of course not.
Ohh!
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
Then he called me a faggot.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
All right, Ace?
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
Nope, there's no way.
In so many words, yes.
Hey, Ace.
I don't wanna come along with you.
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
I lost control?
Please...
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
What people?
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
What are you -
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
I just told you. She called me.
Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
Well, that's why they paid so well.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
Certainly.  Senator.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Sam, we got a problem.
What is it?
Now, he's really pissed.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
You sure?
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Okay.
But as much as they loved her...
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
I didn't take your pills.
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
What's it...
Yeah.
...the rest of the two million is still there?
So, what'd ya do with it?
With the money.
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
I threw it away.
Who were you with?
I mean, it could get us both killed.
Hi, Sam.
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
Oh...
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
Can't do it with both hands?
No, Sir.
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
Can I go in?
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
Come on. I'm sorry.
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
He's not here?
What?
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
Of course, Remo.
Uh-huh. Good.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
You're so nice. 
What? What?
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Let me think about that.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yes.
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
I'm here.
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
...all the luck in the world.
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
Sue me, you Jew fuck!
Yeah, what's to stop him?
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
They'll do it.
Frankie!
How you doin'?
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...
Guilty. I am.
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
You're kidding.
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
Catwomen. Lots of them!
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
I actually got some memory back last night.
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Okay, deal.
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
Taking messages.
You gotta just look the other way.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
How do we get back to the freeway?
I told you I should've cuffed him.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
I don't believe you.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
26th off Wilshire.
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
What do you do for a living?
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
No.
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
The one in Brentwood.
What bank?
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
What's going on?
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Lucky for them they didn't.
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Yes.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
Yes.
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
You timed that beautifully.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
L.A.P.D.
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
He wants 75 back.
Do you think they'll walk away?
What's really on your wicked little mind?
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
Five ... six.
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
Satisfied?
It's in the process.
And not a nickel.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.
Government business?
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
Is that good or bad?
It takes all types.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
Fuck off back to Essex!
He's getting up.
You want me to ask you in, right?
Give me that look again.
What'll it be?
Why?
Why?
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
No...
That's a start.
So I'm sorry.
Will you meet me again?
So they do know.
Are you pretending yet?
Don't ask me in.
I miss you, Jimmy.
So I got it wrong, then.
Yes.
What you doing, Jimmy?
I'm not sure.
You do something for me, Dil?
For me.
Are you all right, Dil?
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
You tried.
And you'll never leave me?
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
It's my name, Dil --
Dil!!!
Yes.
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
Horny bastard.
He's all right.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
She's nobody. She likes me.
Who's the old geezer?
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
Who is he?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
Right.
Eat something, would you?
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
How did you know it was her?
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
Could you?
Why can't we?
Not in your nature.
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
Shouldn't take it personally.
And you play cricket?.
Never.
How different?
Shut up, would you?
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Having a pint in the Rock.
The best.
Do you?
Is it bad?
Don't know her.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
Like the one about the frog?
Why?
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
What?
When you come on, you really come on.
What is it?
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
But I didn't kill anybody.
You didn't have to chase me so hard --
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
I said, tell me to go to the --
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
No, what?
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
But no one actually saw him die.
Oh. Then who's this one?
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
Very good.
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
What's your first name today?
But you're -- divorced?
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
Sorry about that.
Do I knock or something?
Reggie?
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Would you like to see my passport?
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
But I'm not through complaining yet.
They've got Jean-Louis!
That sounds like their problem.
What's so illogical about that?
Shut the door!
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
No -- not yet.
Why don't you shut up!
Are you going to listen?
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
You mean, you're a thief?
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
I'm -- I'm sorry.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
Mrs. Lampert --
About how wealthy would you say?
Did you?
Of course it is.
In Mr. Dyle's room?
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Don't you understand French?
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
How do you know what they're doing?
Yes?
No -- no, I'm don't.
But why do you want a divorce?
He knows everything.
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
I've never seen him before.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
I don't see him.
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
I never fucked Rod.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
No.
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
is there anything you do?
IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
It's almost ten o'clock.
You are upset.
I thought you'd be pleased.
You know her?
Who is she Daddy?
We need you here. I can bring her in.
She's not here.
Can you get inside?
I can.
Really?
Pay no attention to me.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
Who?
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
Stag?
This place is empty.
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
Are you O.K.?
I'm fine.
I heard you got attacked.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
I'm making you feel like meat?
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
Hi princess.
Yes?
You can ask me anything.
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
Did you want one?
Hide your laptop here.
That wasn't me ...

...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
A little early for a delivery.
...-ty.
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
Andy.  Another fuckin'...
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
...-tana.
...-er.
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
I got, uh....
All right, then how about this?

What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
...-ed.
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
Borrowed.
You stole this truck! That's...
Shut up.
    Elvis is on ice again.
 No...
...-er!
 Yeah...
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
Well, then, that means it's call...
...waiting!
Fuck! 
I don't think we have much of a choice...

Come on, old Pete.
Come on.
All right.
All right, let's go.
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
...man!
You're--?  What?!
Keep still.
No!
Oh, no!



What?
...overdrawn bank accounts.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
...split.


Listen, Arlo.
They're takin' off.
We're gonna die!
Hey, hey, hey.
 All right.  Okay.

Okay. 
Okay, here we go.

...-ful?!
Forty-five seven!
What the hell?
We got-...
 Vitelli! Vitelli!
Sorry.
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
They'll meet you at the top.
 Well.
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
I feel faint.
Yeah.
...within five minutes.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
But...
...such is the price...of patriotism.
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
...destroyer of worlds."
No!


...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
Closin' down, sir.

And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
Hit him again.
It's clean.
This was supposed to be a...
...-ther orders?
...-ty.
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
...general store.
...gear?
It's a hundred degrees...
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
I want you to look at one another...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
Hello.


Dead, last time I...




Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
And don't give him any ice cream...
There's something else too.
Ah.
Hit it...
It's not over, Brynner.
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
Who's your suspect?
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
Excellent.
...without caution...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
...public drunkenness....
You redneck idiot, do you have...
  All right.
I'll lead 'em out.


Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.
'Course you do, Jake.
It doesn't hurt.
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
Why is that funny?
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
Yes, his girlfriend.
Yeah.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
She's just no good.
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
Oh they don't?
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Sure thing.
In the garage.
The apple core?
Congratulations.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
I don't want it anymore.
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
You accusing me of extortion?
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
What are you talking about?
Where?
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
No.
What are you having?
I should talk this over with your husband.
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Looks like you went quite a distance.
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
How did you find out?
My husband.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
I can't tell you.
No. I'm just a snoop.
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
What? What is it?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
Why?
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
What were you doing there?
Hold still. Why?
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
Just... I have to.
The Albacore Club.
He owns it. You know?
I can't...
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Sure.
You know any good criminal lawyers?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
That's good. Now what's her name?
With us.
Sophie.
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes...
The water.
Yeah.
No, really?
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
Thanks for all you've done for me.
You understand now? You see it clearly?
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
Elena!...But when...
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
He made an awful lot of money.
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
Wasted?
Charlie?!
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Emily!
Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
Oh yes, there is.
Toothache.
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
How old did you say you were?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
Yes, sir. 
Yes, Mr. Kane.
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
Tired?
Good.
Yes?
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
What?
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
All right.
She's going to leave you -
Yes.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
Yeah, all in crates.
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
Who told you you could sit down here?
If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
What about that apartment?
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
Are you sure?
Are you serious?
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
Thanks. Have a good one.
Beats me.
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
Yeah, but not in here.
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
So where is he?
Why aren't there any lights?
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
Well... kind of, sort of?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
What?
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
You mean, on a date?
Who doesn't?
It wasn't me.
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
All four?
How do you mean?
Wait.
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
Nudie booth?
Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
I know.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
I'm going to miss the game.
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
What happened to all the Gatorade?
Jesus.
No, you're not.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
You were saying?
Broke his neck.
No!
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
I can't fucking believe you!!
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
I'm not. She just left.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
There's no lights back there.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
What are you talking about?
What responsibility?
As if it's that easy.
Leave her out of this.
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
How's your eye?
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
How do you know that?
A half hour.
I should start.
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
You used to go out with her?
It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
So I'm told.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
The white kind.
Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
Why did you agree to come in then?
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
Oh, you think so?
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
Three.
Three?
Three including you.
You've only had sex with three different people?
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
Where?
Let it go...
Lower your voice!
I'm going to class.
I feel sick.
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
What is it?
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
He really wants to play metal?
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
No way!
That's tight. Solid.
To an Asian design major.
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
I hope it feels good.
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
What?
That woulda been cool.
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
Jessie!  Are you alright?
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
I don't understand?
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
He can handle it.
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
Yeah?
A simple yes or no would have done.
We might be able to go that way.
Never, what?!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Take the rope.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
I burned it.
What's he doing?
It's up there, on the Tower.
He never hurt anybody.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
Then where the fuck is!
Oh, my God!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Don't give him anything.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
What did you do that for?
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
You've not been to school all week, son.
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes?
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
Helping you, sir?
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Fine, fine.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
Brown hair, is it?
Blue eyes?
Crabs?
No, sir.
The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
We're going to friends now, sir.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
How many did I get right?
Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
Annie...it's Max.
In my office?
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
I'm...fine.  Fine.
No.
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
Not our call, Phil.
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
Hi, Ma.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Why not?
No.  You say you're cool.
What?
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Two...
South Central.
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
What'd he do to you?
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
I don't know any Rwandans.
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
Vincent?
I never learned jazz.
You mind?  I'm working here.
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
Paid sick leave?
Who?
Yeah, that.
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
Max?
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
Are you crazy?!
Drop me off here!
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
I bit the bastard's nose off.
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Yeah.
Nothing is easy.
What is it with you and the space program?
You want something to drink?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
How'd he die?
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
Realized what?
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Liza?
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Back where?
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
Blue moon... Blue moon...
How did you know?
I'm a very patient man.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
<u>Liza</u>!
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
Can I ask you something?
<u>Why you</u>?
Excuse me?
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
You do recognize it then?
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
So, you doing anything tonight?
This doesn't make sense.
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
Which way did he go?
Agent Lowry.
What gave me away?
What?
Tell me.
So?
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
With me.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
What is it?  What's happened?
What?
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
There is no direct evidence, no.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Many others.
So.  What happens now?
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
I didn't realize I was out.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
It's so... small.
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
Peter Valerian.
Sounds like a Russian general.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
Actually --
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
It's good to see you, Ellie.
Like it or not.
I'm -- I'm fine.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
Maybe you're creating a monster.
I don't think so.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
Ellie --
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
Ellie, what is it?
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Git movin', I said.
Buck is a deal.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
That's good: he earned it.
Tell us about it.
Then how come it ain't done yet?
I don't know, Boss.
Please! Please!
Hey, Tattoo!
So then you just call him.
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
What's the writing say?
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Man, it's so hot.
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
Cuter again.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...
I can't, Andy.
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
I thought he was lying.
When was that?
When he was seventeen.
I was?  How you spell that?
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Where is it?
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
You come and visit.
In jail.
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
Who was the man in the basement?
You know I can't do that.
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
How do you know that?
Then what do you need me for?
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
Why should I trust you?
What's that siren?
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
I don't want this.  What are they?
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
Are you always so bold?
I'll get a locksmith.
Yes.
Is there a phone booth there?
Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?
Look at her legs.
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
How about I put Nikko on it?
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
Where were you?
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
I thought that was you, up there.
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
You could get your wish at any moment.
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
And the party?
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
What do you think?
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
But what am I going to do?
Tell us every detail.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
Ruth's already taken him home.
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
There's a spider in my room.
Lie?
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
Very romantic setting.
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
Your family just met me.
No, I need some serious household advice.
I better make a list.
I love your apartment.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
Silly?   Silly am I?
And all the plans we have.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
Can I put these here for tonight?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
I don't think so.
I think we need to talk about some things.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
So will you?
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
You're there now?
Where's your brother?
Hey Daniel! Hello?  Do you guys speak English?
Good.   I'm good.
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
Yes.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
Half the tapes.
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
You didn't buy batteries?
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
What'd you get?
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Guns.   Can you get them?
They were all French guys.
Just find them!
I don't know.     I didn't look.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
Yes.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
Holy shit.
The money isn't here.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
What does arresting us get them?
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
She seems pleasant enough.
A little?
Okay.    Okay.
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
This Jade Fox is a woman?
Do you think you are a real master?
Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
I owe you nothing.
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
Hello.  What is your name?
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Don't bother.
Please sit.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
You're too young to understand.
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
You're not married, are you?
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
I've missed you.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
Let's end this here.
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
You were enlightened?
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
You think Jade Fox will show up?
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
Save your strength.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
Talent. Hi.
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
Don't thank me.
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
How 'bout the morgue?
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
Does she have a name?
Do you feel okay.
Do you know what you destroyed?
T-Bird?
I can see her.
Neither.
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Don't waste my time.
...necklace... pearls...
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
No shooting.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
Did you know Sebastian well?
Are you okay?
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
Why are you being so dramatic?
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
How's the water?
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Need a lift?
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
I'm busy.
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
Sure. Have a good night.
No.
I think that's for the best.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
Ben Schwarz.
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Something awful happened last night.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
I'm sorry that was out of line.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
You promised to let me kiss you.
I like it better when I'm on top.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
My daughter, Rachel.
Good luck, Sebastian.
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
One.
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
What do you mean?
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
Sounds intriguing.
Why not?
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Any day now.
And that's why you're losing your bet?
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Kind of.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
I'm not in the mood.
And that's why you're leaving?
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
I've never done this before.
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
To my triumph, of course.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
Get out!
What about her?
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Let me get that for you.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
What do you want?
Right after we played backgammon.
Ronald, I'm sorry.
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
Where did you get this ring?
But where did you get it, Amy?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
I got my wish anyway.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
She was very pretty.
Oh, thank you, darling.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
Ollie.
Where did you get it?
Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
Yes, I did.
Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
Daddy, it's true.
No, I didn't.
You'll always play with me?
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
You mustn't be afraid.
I wasn't singing to myself.
Will you come soon?
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
But I only came to give back the ring.
The Headless Horseman --
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
Hide me? Why?
Hurry!
I hate the storm. I hate it!
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Where?
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Hey, did you get contacts?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
Are those Mark's?
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
What the hell is the tampon test?
No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
Charming Carlton.
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
I've been here. What day is it?
Holy shit, I don't know.
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
You're such a good friend.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
I think George knows.
I'm really tired.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
I really gotta pee.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
Wow.
Coffee and...
You busted me.
So what book did you buy?
Used to? Did it stop finally?
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
No. I was doing my laundry.
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
What happened?
What's that supposed to mean?
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
Is it that funny?
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
Go away. I might hurt you.
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
Worse than this?
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
No, I have a cat.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
See he was cheating from the get go.
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
Madonna's in Penthouse?
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
What of?
What's he doing here?
How will we interrogate them?
He tried to kill me!
What is this place?
Was that for real down there?
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
No, it's the truth.
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
Holy cow.
What the hell is this?
I'm... not... nobody...
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
... what?
Nightmare...
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
Till what?
I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
Fine.
`Dave'?
Now he's making stuff up about me.
And it's proving quite effective...
What are they?
They re not my attack dogs.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
What?
Didn't mean to bum you out.
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
What?
What?
It was okay?
Well I guess...
Hi.
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
Tonight?
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
What?
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
NOOOOOOOOO!
God....damn you, Rhodes!
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright.
Oh, I have no doubt.
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
You fired that shot, didn't you?
What do you mean you don't know?
Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
Yeah?  Like what?
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
Nuwanda?  Please?
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
All right.  I'll second that.
It's Nuwanda.
You what?!  How did you do that?
What happened? Were you kicked out?
This is stupid.
Stop what?
What are you doing?!
So, uh, where are you in school?
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Chris!
Then come with me.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
A crazy madman.
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
All right!  What'd she say?
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
But father, I'm assistant editor.
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
Want to come to the study group?
So?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
what?
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
I'm not staying here!
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
Self sufficient...
The "come back" kind.
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
Let's just keep going.
It's okay...come on...
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
What the hell does that mean?
Maybe plans changed...
I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water.
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
What's there to think about?? That THING back there...
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
You're full of shit!
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
Who? Who is?
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
I got delayed. I --
Fucking A.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
I have to go.
I came to see Merle.
Thanks.
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Yeah?
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Biederman!
Linda, what's the matter?
What?
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
What?
I'm just so lonely.
Up north.
Playing?
No. No, no.
I know.
You do?
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
We what?
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
Where's Vince?
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
Yeah.
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
The fuck I did!!!
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
Mug sheets.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
I want to stop aging.
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
Sir, your transmission's fading.
Yes.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
Demolition Man.
You all right?
Yeah.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
This little thing says I can't.
Jabez! Careful --
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
Howdy, Hank.
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
No. She's gone.
She couldn't be gone!
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
No, Stone!
-- in gold.
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Now run along, Daniel.
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
Where did it come from?
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
Look here now--
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
What -- what's on your mind?
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
Coming along, Jabez?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
Jabez!
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
What do you think of that, Jabez?
Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
Consarn the consarn --
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
Of course not --
Say, that's pretty good, young man.
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
It's corny, but I could live with it.
Ellis, what have you told them?
Hans, he killed by brother --
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
Three down, four to go --
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
Is that him?
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
Yes, I would.
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
What about the kids?
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
What am I supposed to do?
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
I'm afraid.
They're okay.
I frisk you?
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
Come on.  I want you to see something.
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
Yeah ...
You're full of shit ...
Well, what were you doin' back there?
Yeah?
Well, they go to guard school.
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
Where's the air conditioning?
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
Sure - we like you.
Mister Mulvaney?
Yeah?
I didn't eat any pizza.
How did you know your son was involved?
Yeah.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
You stopped?  Why?
Pure?
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
Ah, Jesus...
Let's go, Sonny.
He wants one.
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
I'm here.
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
Bullshit!
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
What can he do, he's clean...
I can't allow that, Sonny...
Oh - Maria!
What are you trying to pull?
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
Robbing a bank.
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
Newsman, not ...
<i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i>
What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.
Tell him it's not cute. Will you tell him, Domino!?
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
I'm so sorry to be bothering you in the middle of the night like this... but it's a bit of an emergency.
Okay.
I don't know.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
Chi-Chi!  CHI-CHI!
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
<i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.

Not really.

Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
Mookie.
You the man.
Make it plain.
How long?
Good morning.
I didn't.
OK.  OK.
That's it?
Ten.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
Hurry up and get dressed.
Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it.
C Duracell.
WAKE UP!
Can ya dig it?
ML?
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
Later for you.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?
Mister Seor Love Daddy is cool.
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Then we could try something else.
The both of youse, shaddup.
Oh my god, are you alright?
In the new library there.
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Excuse me?
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
What?
What are you wearing?
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
I haven't seen you around here before.
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
H A R R Y...
Peg leg?
Whoa. What was that?
Shut Up! Buttlick!
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
I didn't know that.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
These are really cold, huh?
Owww... refreshing.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
...cause you said...
You can't marry my mom.
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
You're always your harshest critic.
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
Who?
Yeah, that's why I asked.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
Cute puppy.
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Try one in a million!
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
So can I come along?
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
I'm so close I can feel it.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
Okay.
Have you got what I want?
You know I do!
Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
We start our own class?
And, take some more pictures.
What?
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Yes?... How was your journey?
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
Basically...
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
I'm sorry Gurney.
Things have been so serious here lately.
Paul!!  Paul!!
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Always.
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
Greetings.  I am the Count.
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
It is my home.
Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
I have no next picture.
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
Goulash.
What's in the needle?
"Greetings.  I am the Count."
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Don't worry.
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
These shoes are itchy.
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
Will he be okay?
What?
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
It's a damn good role.
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
You could say that --
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Mr. Reynolds!
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Tor, I should be getting home.
There's still a sex-change --
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
Maybe it needs special handling.
Did you find it boring?
The sun.
Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
Lines around the block.
Yeah...?
You're <u>sure</u>???
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
You think she really likes him?
You know what would be great?
What?
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
Uh-huh?
Yeah?
Leave her be.
I don't think so.
This guy.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Mr. Pekurny.
Mm...  Oh, man...
Really? They were..
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
Right, right...
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
He made a mistake.
He says --
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
Mom?
Who?
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
Ma...
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
What are you doing?
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Shari, I really like you...
No. Who?
Twenty-nine.
So?
Where?
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
What?
You brought the cameras here!
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
I was in jail.
Oh!!
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Can I help with anything?
pierdo.
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
Yeah, just --
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
Looks good to me.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
So Tracy?
Why are you doing this?
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
Uh, Jim?
What is it. Tammy?
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
I also like bananas.
And 290 "disregards," right?
She's doing this to get back at me
Thought what?
Hell, good luck!
Paul, get out!
What'd I do?
I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
Somebody hit you?
When they deserve it.
Did they deserve it today?
Look.  I want to see you again.
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
So tell me about it.
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
Of course... But how?
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
What was that boyfriend's name?
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
Dudley's guys.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
Ellis Loew.
Of course...
What little studio?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
More.
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
What do you mean?
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
I don't have time.  I have --
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
Nobody.  At least not yet.
Gone.  Not a trace.
And?
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
What's this all about, lad?
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
What's on the call sheet?
Why do men and women usually see each other?
Some reality.
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
Under the house.
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
Something like that.
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
Really?  How?
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
Someone else?
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
What do you mean?
Look, my wife is understandably--
I didn't use my name.
I called from a payphone!
None of your business.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
They come after you?
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
Here?
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
What if we just fucked with 'em?
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
Law enforcement?
Yes. I have her permission.
Remain calm.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
A police report.
About the accident.
Somebody took my blender.
No.
To buy lingerie.
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
Just for the criminals.
I saw a man die.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Sorry.
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
I've seen it.
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
I see her for business.
I know.
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
What happened to your head?
I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
Never.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
It's not me?
Yeah?
Otherwise you may have to what?
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
Where's mom?
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
How long can you stay?
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
Christ!
Yes.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
I have a family.
Yeah?
It's been a few years.
Are you okay?
Are you still in Crystal City?
He got hit by a bus.
It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
What the hell does it mean?
What?
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
Sir--
I just meant--
Oh, let's assume that they have.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
You sing.  All the time.
I do not.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
You don't sew at all!
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
No.
It's a folk song.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
Don't do this.
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
It hurts too much.
Why did you hate me?
Don't leave me!
Tell me about your garden.
What did you think you were doing in his tent?
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
Right.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
I told you so.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
What do you want?
Yeah, for a while.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
Where did you find that?
She can take you as far as Florence.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
Irving Berlin.
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
The team is in mourning, darling.
Oh.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
Candaulesyou're laughing at me.
I can already see.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
I'll probably marry him.
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
I'm still here.
Never heard of it.
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
I'll always go back to that church.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
No.  He's - no.
Hello.
Your book.  Your Herodotus! Almsy looks uncomfortable.
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
He's on to something bigger.
I have a question...
Uh, yes.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
You're not taking me seriously.
No. Why would I be?
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
You can't.
That's entrapment.
And good morning.
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
I didn't mean to get personal.
Thank you.
You're nervous again.
Aren't we all.
It's your mistake.
The big job.
Your share.
Oh my god, I thought--
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
That was a lifetime ago.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
Jesus God, it's going through.
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
Right.
You damn well thought wrong.
She's calling the shots now.
Call it an expression of trust.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
250,000?
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
What's she doing here?
There's more than one?
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
Yes?
You're a lawyer?
I'll say.  Holy moley.
Yeah.
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
All I have is hundreds.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
What now?
No shit.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
What kind of truck?
What kind of things come up?
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
You're not gonna be there.
Fuck Kurt.
Ho - ly - shit.
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
Pattee?  That your middle name?
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
PG& -- Are you sure?
Can I play roller hockey?
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
You got more than one?
Why not?
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
What are you doing here?
You're not nothing, Erin.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
You already packed up your stuff?
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
You're moving away?  When?
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
The Emperor?
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
I'm cold ... so cold ...
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
Ben ... Ben ...
... Luke, you must not go.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Barks and growls at his boss.
Barks at Han.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
... Like we're being watched.
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
You, too, golden rod.
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
Probably an asteroid field ....
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
I take it back.
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
We've got to get out of this shower.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
He found him in a junk pile ...
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
No thanks.
Thanks to you.
Probe?  What probe?
No.
It's a lovely outpost.
What'd you say?
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
You rest now.
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
I don't believe it.
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
No!
I'll die first.
The Hoth System?
Yes, My Lord.
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
And we can watch ...
May I say something personal?
Please
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
Oh Cuervo...
It's so good to see you again.
Shit.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
Defense against what?
Where do I put ashore?
Not you?
Locked.
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
Where'd they go?
I said pull over.
Looking to get out.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
Where?
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
How do we get out of here?
Run, Snake...They're coming.
Well, I'll think it over.
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
Ye...
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
I'm going.
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
I will run.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
To kill and be king, is that all?
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
Hello?
Hi, how'd your day go?
Here.
Oh great, anything else?
What's this?
Burke.
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
Groceries maybe? A package?
Would you like some more coffee?
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
A man to see you.
Morning.
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
And those lies she's been telling?
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Chris MacNeil?
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
No.
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
To begin with it could make things worse.
Could you see her?
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
Is she gonna die?
Hey, where'd this come from?
I found it.
You've been playing with it?
You really don't want me to play huh?
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
I wouldn't talk.
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
What?
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
I don't know, I just thought.
How do you know?
Why does God let us get tired?
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
Do it again.
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
Why this girl it makes no sense?
Have we met?
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
Come on!
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Who is it?
We have some lotion.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Honey ...
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
Go fuck yourself.
What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
That's not the point.
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Count it.
You're their uncle.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
No, I mean it.
Says who?
Terrific.
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
It wasn't like that.
That's what we agreed.
What are you, crazy?
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
I'll drop the eighths.
Where the hell is she?
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
Awe inspiring.
Get out of here.
Come on, stand still.
Make it collect.
Very realistic.
Day.  Wednesday.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
Why would I mind?
What?
What're you doing down here?
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
You're making things up, Frank.
Jack!
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
Yeah?
The audience was a little off tonight.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
What do you mean?
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
When?
Changed?
It's orange!
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
I said I was sorry.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Maybe it's legit.
Virgins?
Smells like fish.
Great?
Hey, will you look at that?
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
I'll call you.
Don't worry about it.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
Pretty much.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
You miss him, don't you?
Forget it.
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
What's that supposed to mean?
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
You were good.
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
My father proposed to my mother in there.
They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
He had a mind that escalated things.
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Coffee?
You don't pick your brother.
So how's the cat food business?
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
How do you know?
I guess it's getting serious.
What's a prom?
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
Merry Christmas, Jack.
John.  It's good to see you.
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
Hey, bro ...
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Is someone there?
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
What -- what are you doing?
They're too tight.
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
I'm just having some fun.
I'm not going anywhere.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
I'm going to the powder room.
Excuse me?
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
And I know people.
Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.
But I think I like you better this way...
Who did?
Do you like kids?
Thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.
Were friends, arent we?
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Hey, you cant park that thing here.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Cmon Jack...
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
Yeah?  What do you need?
I've got everything I need.
Look, I dont know what youre getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
Whats this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
Its lovely...
Finger food...?
Are we finally being honest?
Mr. Mintz?  I dont think so...buildings closed pal.  Youll have to come back tomorrow.
For us, Kate.
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...
No, youre right.  What are we doing?
Because thats where I live.
Fine, shes the kids dog.  Lets go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
But its twenty degrees outside...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
Youre so...beautiful...
A perk for what?
Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
I'm sorry...
Thats the one...
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Mrs. Peterson.
Where is he?
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I'm not really dressed for a party.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Ben --
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
Ben, come in.
What do you want, Vic?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
What?
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
So are you!
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Me like-y.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
You <u>were</u>?
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
We're pushing oxygen today.
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
Such as?
What do you mean?
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
Yes...
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
If there's any chance --
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
You have no right to blame Duval --
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
Sort of.
Thirty-two minutes left...  But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
Where's my daughter?
Drop that fucking money!
Certainly -
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
Clear him off the road.
Huh?
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
Personal matters.
What the heck d'ya mean?
Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand.
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
Yah, okay, but, uh -
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
End a April.
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Uh-huh.
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
Just a general way.
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
Uh-huh.
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
You're not a C student.
Uhn.
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
What's the next step here, Jerry?
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
Huh? Yah?
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
Sir? Right now?
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yah, so we're all set.
Yah, how much money was that?
Jerome Lundegaard?
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Are you calling Stan?
Yah, pretty good.
Whatcha watchin' there?
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
No kiddin'?
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
The heck d'ya mean?
Mm.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Yah?
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
No, I didn't...
Margie Olmstead?
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.
The day of our homicides.
Yah?
Thanks, hon.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
It's terrific!
Yah, I guess.
You are a moron.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
No.  I found something new.
What does that mean?
Can't you give me something?
Practicing what?
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
A year?  How'd you manage that?
You... don't have to... leave.
Guy or girl?
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Say my name!  What's my name!?
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Hello?
Tyler?
You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
No, supply oxygen?
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
How's that working out for you?
...no ...no ...
Would that be a problem?
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
But a good strange.
Call what off?
You're sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
Promise you won't.
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
... Marla ... ?
What are you doing?!
"Applicant?"
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
Why do people think anything?
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
The house is rented in your name.
What about Marla?
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
Yes...
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
You want out?
I quit.
Ask me nicely.
One minute.
Please...
... no, no, no...
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
Look at me...
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
You're welcome to join our club.
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
Yeah, how?
What about that?
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
That lucky bastard.
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
Take a guess.
This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
Yeah, so what happened?
What's going on here?
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Tell me again how it started.
How do you know?
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
You mean the snake?
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
Ninety.
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
This place is a trip.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
I'm getting him out.
Are they going to torture us?
Gawd, you look awful.
You comin'?
Where did you find this clown?
I thought he was with you.
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
Why me?
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
Black.  No sugar.
It's not necessary.
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
I was attacked.
No, I'm fine... really...
I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
He's not a moron.
And who's Lydia?
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
Where you comin' from?!
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Lydia.  Lydia what?
They're --  -- What?
Parry.
Parry... I'm Jack.
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
Why did you do that?
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
It's such a great song.
.....What are you doing?
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
What?
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
Are you all right?
Parry Parry?
I don't like horror movies!
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
I don't drink coffee...
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
Listen, you're very nice... b...
No, I...
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
I did, didn' I, El?
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
No.
Rayette.
Just finish eating.
Am I on TV?
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Daddy's very ill.
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
It's not that bad.
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
What?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
It's none of your business!
Bye, now.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
I didn't have any.
Wait...
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
That's what you said?
That'll make you happy.
I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
Well...
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
There's some good things on it, though.
Miss Dupea.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
What?
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Wussup?
Nothin'.
Whadja wanna see me about?
Of course.
Wha'?
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
What she look like?
You wanna do somethin' with me?
I know how ta get him back if you want.
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
Hey you're really nuts.
You're lucky.
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Mrs. Smith.
Well, which one?
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
For sure?
Gum thought Brazil.
Oh my God!
That's it?
My lawyer was a bum.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
You may be right.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Good evening.
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attach cases.
John Ultramalensky, right?
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
Fletch?
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Alan Stanwyk.
I'm all ears.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
They serve dinner on the flight?
Shoot.
Not our kind of people, you understand.
Did you say cops?
Yeah.
I'm sorry?
Cute thing.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
I mean put clothes on.
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
What are you talking about?
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
I was afraid you'd say that.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
No.
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
In her cabana, sir.
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
I recommend it.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
Fletch.
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
Yes?
But I ain't got you...
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
That was close...
What an interface!
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
Spunk, come back...
Because I know rock-n-roll.
People still watch that?
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
I can't kill this kid's father...
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
What are you running from?
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
I'm off it!
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
Fuck me...
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
This isn't music!
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
What?
No... yeah...
It is waiting for you in the garage.
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Twelve o'clock... yes...
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
What happens to the schedule?
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Strike out, eh?
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
Never trust a nigger.
Policy man in Queens.
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
Same car.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
I been damn careful up to now.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
Why haven't they killed the juice?
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
You alright?
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
You give him his drops?
Wish you weren't.
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
Hey, bud.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Hello?
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
What?
What's that?
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
Are you alright"?
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
I'm right here, Dad.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
In my pocket.
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
You're not looking too good.
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
Uh, huh.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
I hear that.
Huh.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Sullivan?
Going?  How do you mean?
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
How do we do it?
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Your bed.
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
Somebody was in here.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
This is no time to celebrate!
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
I thought that was the end of the song.
Whaddya mean?
Ahh, nothing.
But, Dad, we...
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
Why?
Lake Forest Green?
Why?
Which is?
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
So let's talk.
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
The what?
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
Look --
You need to leave.
What's the problem here?
Okay.
Good night, beautiful.
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
I didn't kill her!
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
Have you seen Tamara?
What are you going to do?
Time to check out the waiters.
Did you hear that?
But I thought...
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
I demand to know what is going on...
Did you find Rennie?
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
I'm staying.
She didn't push me into coming.
Can't we at least talk about it?
I...I can't...
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
Did you have an accident in the lake?
I opened thousands of brains.
What did you find?
Crosstown.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
Press a button and they give us money.
We must abandon.
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
I'm not ready.
We're making too much of this.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
How do you Eknow.
This could be it.
Does what feel comfortable?
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
In and out of bed.
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
Except I won't have a father anymore.
What's sexy?
Two-all after six.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
What do you want me to do?
Matthew's my grandson.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
It's the kid's lucky day.
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
It's a complicated subject.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
Because life is good.
Why do you care?
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
Sidney remains optimistic.
Yes, Peter.
Burnt sienna.
Mine was cobalt blue.
A little drastic maybe?
What?
I haven't come to you.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
It is the work of untouchables.
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
You mean Gandhi?
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
Hm.  Is it?
Is it over if they arrest you now?
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
It's split the Government.
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
I like football.
How much extra?
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
A man's dead, Detective.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
What are you waiting for?
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
What's wrong with it?
Suit yourself.
I have to know where you come from.
You wish.
They'll recognize me.
Is that all?
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
Where are you taking her?
Everybody goes there.
Anything I've forgotten?
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
How do I square the accident?
You worried about the cost?
Have they found our friend?
You didn't know?
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
Flight got you nervous?
I get my own help.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
It doesn't look like that.
Half a million.
How's Estelle?
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
You were asleep.
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
That doesn't hurt.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
You've got it all figured.
Only one car.
I want to say something.
Yeah.
What is it?
I don't know, airport I guess.
Are we going to make it?
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
Oh my God.
Can I help you?
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Then you do it.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
What did he say?
Oh ay?
Yeah.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
That's nice.
I can't Jack. How can I?
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Everyhing go off all right?
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
Really.
Nicer than most.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
What was bugging Frank?
Yes.
Yes. I met him last year.
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
We went about together.
Really?
Could you do me a favour?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
What girl?
Then he must have pulled her.
Thanks for coming.
You all right now?
Yeah.
Where you going to live, then?
What?
I mean, what for?
That's what I was wondering.
Why would it?
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
See you later.
It's not like that, luv.
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
What you going to do?
Jack Carter.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Knock it off, Gerald.
Three hundred altogether?
You did?
We're stuck with this...
...this shit...
It's too...
You get a bad month, all of a...
I...
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
He is?
He's doing very well.
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
What hard part?
That's what I...
They...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Somebody...
How?
Huh.
You haven't talked to him.
Yes.
No.  Not actually.
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
Did you talk to Graff?
Is that what I said?
Why would I do it?
Me?
Absolutely.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
In the abstract...
Everything I...you know...
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
To the cops?
Why don't you think so?
Did the leads come in yet?
...how can you talk to me that... that...
Who used to say that?
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...
Excuse me, sir...
Hey, fella, let's get this done...
Mr. Levene...?
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
...no...
Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
Either way.  You're out.
I'm out.
I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per...
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
Now?  Now?
No.
Why?
Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!
The leads are coming.
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
Why I don't...
What?
What are you talking about?
Well, hadn't it?
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Don't.
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
I got 'em in the kitchen.  I'm eating her crumb cake.
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
They took the phones...
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
What is it?
Sure.
You're sure?
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Yeah.
Ricky, I...
Mmmm...
Tell me again.  Your wife.
No.  She told me "right now."
What...?
What power?
She told me not to talk to you.
And the check is...
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
If you don't want it, give it back.
...Mr. Williamson...
Will you take me?
They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
I got surprises for everybody!
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
No.
Would you like some?
You would risk your life for strangers?
The child cannot harm you.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
We're making an investment in Havana.
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
Why?
How long does this go on?
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
He's not the same as when I met him.
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
Yes.
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
Good.  Then you're staying.
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Yes.
I had no idea...
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
Are you Klingman?
Right here.
You said you were Klingman.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
How is his health?
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
Let him gamble.
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
I know.
I want you to settle on their terms.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
You liked it too.
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
What do I do?
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
We have his note.
Just that I was in the Marines.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
All right, I guess.
Is this David's doing?
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
Did you now?
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Did you kill anyone?
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
So you had a wife?
You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
Everybody has stories to tell.
You were a soldier?
Run for what?
It's not like her.
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
I don't remember that one.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
What won't do?
You are much too human.
What was that?
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
Then take the pills.
Yes.  Perfectly.
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
I don't mind.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
You didn't?
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
How's the leg?
What's with the fish thing -- ?
Me, too. Every time I walk...
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You'll leave -- ?
I know you.
Not my girl anymore
The other day....
okay ...
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
C'mon, man ...
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
Forget that ...
Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
Any word, Kip -- ?
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Hey, Kip, what's up?
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
Hey, Kip ...
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
Toby...
What are we gonna do -- ?
He give you an advance -- ?
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
Call 911 -
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
On account of Mitch?
A distinction worth noting ...
Six or seven...
We were good when you bailed, weren't we?
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
Where to -- ?
You remember Junie?
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
Is he still working here ?
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
Not --
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
What? What happened?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Tell him. It's okay.
What did you hear about that thing?
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
Anybody!  You understand?
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
Paulie's gonna make him?
Where'd you find such creeps?
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
Are you okay? What happened?
He didn't call?
He's with his friends.
What kind of person doesn't call?
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
How's the woman?
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
You and Morgan throw?
How'd you know where to find me?
I don't think I...Larry?
And what do you see?
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Hey fuck you.
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
It's right.  Take it home with you.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
Good to see you.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
Who?
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
Now wait a minute--
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
--I'm not angry at you--
Hello, Sean.
Where're you going?
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
Probably not.
Crayons?
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
Watch your mouth.
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Why not?
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
That's right.
They could see that I meant it.
What?
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
I used to go with the wrench.
I know.
It's not...
That's what you want?
Yeah, I think so.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
I'm Will.
I kind of got that impression.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
What?
What?
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
Oh, you will?
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Well...
I've never seen your place.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
How's it goin'?
Fine.
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
Come one Will. I just want to know.
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
Yeah.
Take care.
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
Don't hold me so tight.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Any gas?
I didn't see nothin'.
Can all of you work?
But--but how we gonna eat?
Got a warrant?
You got dances too?
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Yeah. On my way home now.
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
This here's a strike.
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
How about it, Ma?
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Since before they stopped us las' night.
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
I ain't full.
Looks like you done it.
They killed Casy first.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
It's me. Martin Blank.
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
Insane.
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
What's that?
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
I just know.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
How was your day, today, sir?
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Hard to get good help these days.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
Is that right?
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Hello, Bob.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
I don't think so.
--Nooo--
Did you see Blank in there?
No...
I'm not happy.
I have scruples. Next.
That's wonderful, Mom.
No, I don't have one.
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
Of course you will.
That's too bad.
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Doesn't matter.
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
Does Chicago count?
You lived in Chicago?
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Feel good?
How did you meet her?
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
I didn't know I had to.
That's not true!
Then why do you want to leave?
You buckled up?  You cold?
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
What?... Oh baby...
Let's bring your bags inside.
Good.
Yes. We're suing.
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
It's me.
Okay. We'll see you later then.
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
Doing what?
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Everything all right.
Huh-huh. You?
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
You're allergic to hay.
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
No. I am a "tubab."
What do you mean?
You want to take a walk with me?
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
She calls him Tommy...
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
What?
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
It isn't right to make him suffer...
That's what some folks say.
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
I don't know if I can with my leg.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
I can't... not yet...
No, not yet.
You shut up, stupid!
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
What are you looking at, young man?
Does a horse miss a saddle?
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
Shit!
Very impressive.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
Did you talk to him?
Yeah, mom?
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
Up all night again, huh?
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Shit! Come on!
I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
That's Razor and Blade.
Oh, shit! He got me.
Here's your class.
I'm Crash Override.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
Name your stakes.
Make it my first born.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
What?
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
I'll make it up to you!
Shit!!
There they are!
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Die, dickweeds!
What is he doing in here?
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
555-4202.
Purpose of visit?
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
Are you two okay?
What's going on?
What does that mean?
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Found it.
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
I do.
Who you calling?
Like a sister?
It's been eleven months.
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
Jamie, what happened?
Jamie!
I've got you come on, go down.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
Its true, Sheriff.
When he makes that call.
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
Sort of.
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
Now you understand?
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Look where?
Sure, see you later.
He can still watch.
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
Yeah.
Will you call me tomorrow?
Anybody live here?
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
What do we do?
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
You all right?
You have the wrong feeling.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Hey, Laurie...
The bogyman!
I saw him...
You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
Pull up to the entrance!
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
Hi.
Well, let's do it.
Uh, who gets dropped first?
It's French, though.  It really is.
That's disgusting!
What?
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
Mm-hm.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Is this your first job?
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
Like what?
How ya doin', man?
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
Yeah?
Well, are...are they big?
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
Yeah.  How are you?
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Oh.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
Poor Hannah.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
Is something wrong?
They're fantastic.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
I know.
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Are you angry with me?
You matter to me.  Completely.
Hi.  How's she doing?
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
Oh, Mom!
Why should I be afraid?
Are you sure?
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
Because he likes you.
Because I have to!
In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
No.
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
Oh...
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
What are you talking about?
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Oh, he's such a loser!
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
You know.
Boy--
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
Yeah, that's clerical.
You're too demanding.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
God!
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
How are you?
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
I'm okay.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
It's all right.
Boy...Holly...Holly.
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
...I was <u>working</u>...
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
It wasn't my day.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
Yes?
That would adversely impact my income.
Say it in English.
That's right.
Yeah, so where is he?
What else did I miss...?
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
What do you want me to do?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>. 
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
I said how's your baby...?
Give it up.
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
You know America?
Who does not?
...who say...?
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
You look lovely.
...I'm sorry....?
Indeed we were.
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
...when I... 
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
Then we cannot go.
I know where he is.
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
...but:  this particular statue...
What're they on about?
...I feel that...
She must be something special After Dark.
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
I..
You want some <u>advice</u>.
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
What are you doing?
Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off...
I think your passion is terrific.
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
Fuck off.
Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?
Not now, Wendy.
What do you want me to say?
I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....
Because you're an idiot.
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
Heather? Wha...
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
Veronica, you look like hell.
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
Probably....
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
Like a suicide thing?
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
Oh.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
You can be so immature!
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
Let's kick his ass.
I guess.
That's three things.
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
Well, I guess I take after you then!
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
That's coming along well!
gives her a sympathetic look.
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
Just a couple more . . .
Poor Father . . .
I'm coming with you.
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
Sure plenty of times.
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
Zero's a number right?
Good boy.  Where's is it?
But... I thought...
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
What?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
Poor Trevor.
What things do you think you've done?
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
Mister LaPlante...
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
The homeless!
Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important...
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
Lie, you mean...
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Were you in it?  In the war?
You never saw that picture, huh?
Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo.
Uh, no.
I... I know that, John...
John, I know all about it.
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Said he's not an actor.
Helluva story!
My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
He's pretty... remarkable.
What about?
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
Hey, c'mon.
Let's watch some TV.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
And the rent is okay?
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
So, you're just kind of a roving --
I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
Here, take this out to the table.
He doesn't have a temperature.
Thank God.
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
Did you hear that?
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
How long does it have to be a new house?
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
He wasn't there.
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
God, your sister's really hot.
What for, dickweed?
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it?
Do you see a man?
No.
Is it a king or a queen?
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
What is it?
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
I think it was England.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
Central Park.
Where have you been for the last seven years?
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
Agreed.
Why not?
Aye.
Then take me with you.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
Corpses?
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Good evening.
I'm just trying to place you.
Is it?
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
So?
Would you like to see it?
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
How could they get by him?
You know it's not safe here for you.
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Would you care for some water, Conner?
You kept it?
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Talley.
The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
What do you want to do?
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
Talley?
You're a funny guy, Talley.
We been through that.  Forget it.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
I got the gasoline --
What the fuck is that?
I overheard him with the girl.
All right.  Now the second one.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
You sure?
What?
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
Where are they?
That's not enough.
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
What's wrong with the radio?
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
Okay.
Can you get into the office?
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
What is this about?
I used to work at the Diplomat.
Ten.
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
They fired a rocket at us.
Satellites.
Satellites?
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
The police are very busy.
I'll be over.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
You know what the Scottish call it?
No, sir.
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
How so.
I led no massacres.
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
Here, have a sandwich.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
When will they be here?
Mr. Manager.
Can we phone them in, Paul?
I would never do that.
That will take time.
The commander is not here.
Excuse me.
But who is left?
What for Paul.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
Why?
It was substantial.
What sort of plan?
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Why the hurry, Roger?
Can I help you?
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
Melissa!
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
Where is it??
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
You said that was an accident.
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
I'll meet you down there.
-- the stained glass --
Why?
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
This is the best we're gonna do.
It's succeeding!
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
Don't touch me!
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
You're hurting me.
Really? Well, let it rip.
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
Where is she?
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
Steven --
No...
You think this is fucking funny??
I was upstairs!
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
Rewind that.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
Won't do any good.
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
Excuse me?
What's the matter?
What will they tell you?
I'm sorry.
She says she's lonely...
Help me!  Please!!!
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
Are we going back to California daddy?
Good night Angel...
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
I just, I don't know...
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
She's gone!
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
Are you all right?
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
Maura.
What...amulet?
What are you getting at!
And what would you do?
What?
Well what is it!
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
Uh-huh?
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
What?
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
That's great.
I'm trying to quit.
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
"You could be swinging on a star."
"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
Don't you just hate kids...
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
I'm going to find out.
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
Way to go, Anna.
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
Sharp.
With a little jazz.
The Shazzammeter!
The Daddy-Oh!
The Hudswinger!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
It's hardly the same --
Hungry, anyway.
...You know! For kids!
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
...Certain people are --
You know, on farm route 17.
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
You don't say.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Hey! Where's that martini?!
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
I can't print this!
Watch it, Archer --
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
But, buddy --
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
...It is?
Geez, I --
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
Well, I made the dean's list.
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Hello, Niagara.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
Where?
That's nonsense, Alma.
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
I think you need some help.
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
Mrs. Rand...
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
But it's so far away...
Is she a doctor?
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
That doesn't sound like him.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
Have the servants made you comfortable?
I am not a frightened girl.
And charming?
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
What do you think?
You crying?
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
Yeah, that one.
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
In the car.
I'm not.
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Elena.
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
Classes?
Grades?
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Huh?
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
Oh.
Social work?
Educated guess.
They say you never forget.
You ask what the point is?
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
Where you going?
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
Flame on, asshole.
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Huh?
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --
My what?
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
Who said so?
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
Yeah. Yours?
Watching what?
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
What time is it?
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
Hey Wendy.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
Communist Viet Cong.
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
So far.
You did your homework, Officer.
She your only sibling?
Oh, I shouldn't have...
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
I don't remember.
It's legitimate.
Sorry about...
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
Where you signed this?
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
He's just rattling your cage.
No way.
I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids...
Fred Duggar?
What is it?
One of your cases?
Will.
What if someone finds out?
You and Kay were like sisters?
She used some stupid code name.
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Thought you might find that.
But you wanted to.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
What the hell do you know?
Yes.  Like that.
This an accident, Walter?
Who made us what we are?
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
No, my beloved, my child.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
And if I cut my hair again?
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
Claudia - don't -
You... fed on me?
What was that?
Yes.
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
I can't do it.
You really want to be with them?
It can't be...
Have you ever been caught?
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
No... You come back to me Louis...
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
How could I not? She had to know.
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
Is that bad?
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
Sorry. Emergencies only.
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
What are you doing in my closet?
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
Julie?
No, you're not.
Yeah.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
I'm fine.
To get out of Southport?
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
To a great weekend --
You guys lost?
He leave you?
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
We will see who is the first to die.
There was some trouble here the villagers on the mainland -this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
I have forgotten it, dear.
Miss Wollsten!
You wouldn't tell that 
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
I don't understand you.
Her family name?
What is her illness?
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
Listen to what I say --
Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble  the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
All right  all right.
Stand back.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
What'd you say?
I said I wish I'd never been born.
What did you say?
Made what?
What?
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Well, naturally. Of course.
I want you to take a good look at that face.
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!
I know. I know.
Thank you very much.
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Hi, Daddy.
Will you try to get some sleep?
It will?
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
Nice girl, Mary.
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
Where are you going?
No, George, don't . . .
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
All of it?
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
With coconuts?
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
Where'd you get that dress?
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
Please, let's not stop, George.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
Oh, George, George!
Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner.
What plates?
I guess you forgot something.
What?
How about that one there?
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
You coming up on him?
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
Happy to do it.
I know just where to go.
What else is there to do?
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Mike?  Is that you?
Pop.  I'm sorry.
Too late, it's written.
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
The whale's mouth?
We don't know that, do we?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
Okay, so that's it.
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Fooling around?
Nothing.
Are you going to be able to sleep?
What's wrong?
What'd I say?
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
I'll give notice.
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Did you say Cable Junction?
Dad!  Dad!
I told you, remember?
Ready?
Tina Wilcox.
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
Shut up.
Come on back up here!
Nope.
Give me back my hat!
What about sailing?
Mmmmmm.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
Anything.  Anything.
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.
Hurry, please.
About damn time.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
No.
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
Well, not much longer to go.
You called, Doctor?
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
And what else is bothering you?
It's his work.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Where's the rubber band?
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
It's romantic down here.
Make up your mind.
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
I know I can capture it.
Change your mind?
You don't.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
So?
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
Somebody better get down there!
Come on!
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
Well, then I'm going to film it.
Afraid I can't do that.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Why are you?
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
Philip.
That's because I am the shark.
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.
She, Mister Hutton.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
Give me a ride?
So, you just get here?
Yeah, from Boston.
Massachussettans aren't.
I don't know, it depends.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
Besides that.
Take it up!
That?
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Look great, don't I?
Took it this morning.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Sure.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
Turn it off....
Off....
You want to try your hand at something...?
At least he doesn't have a beard....
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
Stop that....
The fish.  Check it....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
Where do I pull off...?
I have two right feet.
Our little island seems to agree with you....
That's hard to imagine....
Won't you get in trouble...?
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
It's not a bad life, Jake....
I don't know shit about electronics....
Hoagie.
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
The van?
Someone bet me a dollar ..
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
Did he shut you down?
Sure.
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
Have you got a print from the hand?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
Vehicle references.
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
You must have some idea about him.
Did Amber have a dog?
No.
Are you married?
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
I have to talk to you, Helena.
You know? How do you know?
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
Yes, Sir.
A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
He's happy, darlin ..
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
Well, no you didn't --
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Well, take care.
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
Beer okay?
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
You want...
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
Wait. Where is he?
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
Thank you.
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
Ten seconds, Rod.
I'll give it everything.
Not right now, Jerry.
Yes.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
Another drink please.
That's your word?
Great word.  Towel?
You're telling me to dance.
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
How do I know?
No, I don't know.
I'm asking you a question --
That's an answer.
Beautiful.
What --
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
Jerry --
-- and I'll get 'em.
Funny.
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
Her new boyfriend.
Sorry.
How much weight have you lost?
You look good.
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
What did you say?
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
PAUL!
You rented an automated litter box.
It looks intact.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
Anything good?
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
Good luck with the fund raising.
In Costa Rica?
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
Are you sure?
That's hard to believe.
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
Amanda!
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
It matches the pictures.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
Oh --
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
Is that kid still bothering you?
That was about a year ago.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
No.
We can't stay in here!
It'll hold!
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
Where's Kelly?
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
Oh, I'll get 'em all.
They are?  I'll be damned.
Pretty sure.
There you are.  Out you come.
Oh my God.
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
- - and swallows fresh ones.
Are you sure?
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
Why not?
No.
Alan, listen to this.
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Faster, faster!
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
Are they heavy?
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
I doubt it.
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
You have no idea.
Machines hate you?
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
We gotta do something.
No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
It's safe.
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
I'll stay awake.
Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, thats all it is!
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Who is this? What's going on?
What are the charges?
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
Doesnit sleep?
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
Yeah, what is it?
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
An empty tomb?
Then its authority is in doubt.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
You wanted to see me, sir.
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
I do.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
I suspected that he -- well.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
-- I don't know the Musil district.
What of it?
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
Gabriela! -- you did get away.
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
Your office is the Workmen's --
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
Maybe it's true then what she said.
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
Father!
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
Can you fly?
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Native costume?
Did you see her?
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
What?
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
Coz of something I lost.
She was with you after she left Frank.
Yes?
I do not love him.
You think people hate you.
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
-- We can talk --
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
What is it?
-- Tuscarora --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
I go on rounds.
Can't you get him?
He never told me.
Did you like my friend Frankie?
No.
Yeah, you got to me.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
What's the matter?
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
I don't get you.
We did this before.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
What's in it?
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
Then how are you involved?
No.
No.
Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
Playing.
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Mom, I mean dad...
That's okay.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
Salisbury steak.
No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
Daddy?
Good night.
Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
Is this really your desk?
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
No, she never did.
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
Where will my toys be?
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
And would you describe those years as happy?
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
And what is your present salary?
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Yes...
No.
No.
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
Yes.
I was not a failure.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
What about Billy?
What?
I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault.  I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...
You've been living here, in the city?
You want what?!
Joanna, I don't give a--
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
Three months.  How can you tell?
I know....I know.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
You're sure?
California?
Uh, huh...Yeah...
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Ted.
Hey, that's terrific.
Ted, I just heard...
Where are you from?
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
I am sorry, Lhamo.
I do, now.
And you have horses? You love horses.
Here. We'll collect them.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
I am afraid.
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
Holiness?
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
No. Not very big.
He warned about the future of Tibet.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
I will not go.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
Is that a true story, or pretend?
What do you think?
I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
I have more men.
I want to go down there.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
We cannot.
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
Hmm.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
And you like me.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
Jesus Christ!!
Is this a trick?
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
No!
No way.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
Nothing's real.
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
They could try to tranq him on land.
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
How big do the bears get?
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
So I don't like tents, why--
I beg your pardon?
That was an awful thing to say to me.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
You <u>did</u>, you--
What?
Thing we can lift it?
Well...
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
What's that?
I'm fine, thank you.
You have a thing against museums?
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
A tooth?
<u>Kelly</u>--
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
Backstabber?
What girl?
"- every day."
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
Why not?
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
I think so.
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
Yes.
How many women has he used, our Bill?
Five... so far.
Then please - do this test for me.
I never thought about it.
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
Where will we go?
Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
And by sea!
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
We don't.
I don't understand!
And if we're unlucky?
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
And what is that?
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
Sergeant Major!
"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
This interview's over! The militia stays!
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
La victoire.
Be careful with it.
No!
That's an order!
Your suit, Becky!
Sixpack?
What can we do?
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
Made your million, yet?
What the?...
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
What is it?
The shack...
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
How much did you part with?
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
Apart from those shotguns.
I thought this was a pub.
Like antiques.
Yeah, Bazza, what?
Nope.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
Right, his leg's going now.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Invitations?
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
And look what happened to that.
Well, what's going on?
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
What do you mean?
What the hell are you doing here?
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
You will what?
I'll see ya.
That you, boy?
I want your bar.
Do you want me to draw a picture?
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
Look. Go on, look.
Tom, you're all heart.
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
They stole our land--
I can fix cars.
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
So you knew this young man before?
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
Out of the Army?
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
How's business?
Everybody on the border knows that story.
So is Buddy on your short list?
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
That's not the point.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
You little pissant--
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
You were in a fight--
No. You?
Hey, it's the General.
You've been in this house for a while?
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
The Trail of Tears.
Same as they done in Mexico.
PDA?
He's still pissed off about it.
Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
Dad--?
You wouldn't?
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
Something like that.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
You going to get married?
Mikey--
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
So where does that put us?
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
That's where he fell.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--]
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Quien es? [Who is it?]
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
No.
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
Charley Wade.
I got an idea what happened.
Fellas.
Imonna find out one way or the other.
There was a mandate in the last election--
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
Mami, how old were you when my father--
Right. When he was killed.
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
Could of been. That was white people's business.
What's she singing about?
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
I thought he busted you a couple times.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
Your boy, there--
You don't want to be Sheriff.
Like your story is over.
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
How 'bout you?
Don't know if I'll still want it.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
Otis what?
Payne.
Runnin' numbers illegal.
How much?
Who?
How?
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
Thanks, Billy.
You did.  Didn't you?
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
He's a priest?
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
And are you afraid?
Did your husband know Quaid?
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
Does that mean...?
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
It was more than that, I think.
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
I told you --
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
And this Butterfield guy--
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Are you sure?
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
A ticket home,
Yeah, I know.
Yes.
Yes.
What about?
The Puritan?
Harry D'Amour.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
So Nix won't come looking for her?
I don't know what else to do.
And he didn't have them?
And you believed him?
Yes?
Maybe... I... don't...
And?
Not true.
No!
What are you doing here?
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Did I scowl at you?
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
Where's your husband?
Well... have a good flight.
Yes?
Mr. Harris?
Yes?
Hello, darling.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
Ok, well... I love you.
Bob?
Uh, no.
What are you talking about?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
Fine.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
What?
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
You smell weird.
See you later.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
What time did you make it for?
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
He will.  He has great faith.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
You fucking bastard.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
You raised me, like a son.
Why are you doing this to me?
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
May I help you?
Yes... and you are?
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
Why did he try to kill me?
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
I know who he is.
But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
I plan to.  You want a tip?
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
What's the matter with you?
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
Where is she now?
No I don't.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
The blue.
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
You're a caterer?
Sort of.
That was nice.
What?
I don't wanna see that.
You might be the only one with a job.
I know.
Just one word of advice for next season.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
How's that been?
What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
For real?
I just can.
I never knew a girl that could play.
Your Dad play?
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
What's that?
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
See you made it.
I've been trying to find you all day.
Who was that?
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
The "man" again.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
So that's it, just forget about us?
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
Tried calling you a couple times.
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
Then why are you so upset?
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
So?
We should head over.
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
Not great.
We were just studying.
Still the man.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
What people?
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
What mess?
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
What?
So what are you gonna do?
Lucky kid.
And some things should never fucking happen!
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
No.
You want me to fuck off?
No need for braces, Donnie.
What's wrong?
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Uh-huh.
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
Brain and Lung.
It's a helluva disease.
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
For what?
Yeah, but I don't know --
And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
What are you lookin' for?
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
If you're not here for a 422 --
yeah, good, ok.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Please, yes.
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
It's my favorite place --
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
Well.
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
Just say no.
-- what kind?
Cynthia?
What?
How much time do we have?
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
Is it real love?
Well --
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
Picky, picky.
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
Yeah.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
I'm trying.
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
Go fuck myself?
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey --
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
I think you have the wrong number.
Is this 509-9027?
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
I'm gonna start rolling --
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
So boring, so useless --
This isn't meant --
Go ahead and waste your time.
What am I doing?
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
Where are you from originally?
the valley?
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
She's retired.
Psychology major?
Do you have your masters?
They wouldn't?
Uh. huh.
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
You're just come in --
Calm down.
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
Marcie.
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
No.
All your other fluzzies?
Will you say my name?
You want her right now?
Did you tell her?
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
Who?
No.
Two years...three years...
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
I don't know....
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
I think that you know.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
I'm Bob.
Want me to wake her up?
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
Let me call you a car, Linda.
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
Yeah.
yeah.
What are they gonna do -- beat us?
C'mon, man.
You coulda been in front --
You ready to keep winning?
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
...what...?
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
What -- ?
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
No, Louis!  No!
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
It can.  I know the way.
What are they doing?
But -- what is he doing?
Hang himself?!
You're a fool!
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
We go someplace dangerous.
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
He's going to kill you, Aramis.
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
Die?  What...?
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
I decided it this morning.
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
Continue.
Eh?
You've... memorized...?
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
Exactly why it should be given away.
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
I... we are humble people...
Captain Doyle?
Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
Bullshit...
I'll take the south end -
Gotta come from somewhere...
Did he harm the girl?
Did you read today's paper?
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
No...I'm in some trouble...
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
1490...Breckinridge...
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
Ditched you?
Where is he?
Long gone, huh?
What have we missed?
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
Get him to Atlanta.
You said the guy down here is good.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
The mark? Yes.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
I'll pick you up in...
That's narrow?
'Changes?'
It does, doesn't it?
Will...?
Wait for the back-up! Will?
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
In eight days.
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
Yes, are you okay...?!
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Come in.
In a holding cell.
Linda doesn't come in nights.
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
Okay.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
I don't understand.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
I don't want to do that,
What's average?
To yourself...
No.
If I were?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
Do you remember what you said?
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
And... where are things?
Will? Are you okay?
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  That man, Crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
Stuart is fine.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
No.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
Tank you veddy much.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
Sitcom...?
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
You have to do it.
I refuse.
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
Those are my terms.
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
We were just trying to push the envelope --
Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
So how can I help you...?
So who's gonna pay for it?
I can't move my arm.
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
No thanks.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"...
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
Are you at peace with your family?
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.
Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
Why is he saying these things?!
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
What?!
You got the money?
Don't be ridiculous.
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
The Matrix isn't real!
What are you doing?
Is that...?
Do you always look at it encoded?
Dead.  All dead.
All right --
What is he doing?
Hello?
You could say that.
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
The Matrix?
What did she tell you?
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
And you still believe I'm the One?
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
From what?
That's different.
What did she tell you?
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
Can you fly that thing.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
They're hacking his mind.
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
Sounds good.
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
Yeah.
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
Where to?
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
Didn't show up.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
Don't promise...just deliver.
I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
Hey...you got nothing here.
Don't be smart.
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
C'mon Johnny.
$20.
Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
Well, maybe you missed something?
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
Nothing.
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
You could say that.
How much?
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Can you spare it?
-- But he does seem very nice.
He's coming.
That was 'Joe'.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
I know you do, darling.
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
And that?
What are you eating.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
We have an arrangement now.
Thank you.
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
A voice?
'Yes' to the deal?
Did you just hear something?
Yeah, something he goes by --
Yes.
No --
I am now.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Rass!
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
And you're a nice man, Quince.
Confused, huh?  About what?
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
Yes --?
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
Excuse me?
Yes...
I am, too.
'To bed'?
You first.
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
I loved it.
I love you now, I'll love you always --
You think so?
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
Well, thank you for letting me know.
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
Bill --
Yes?
Of course.
Excellent.  What is it?
Truly - uh - splendid.
I don't know.
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
You're what?
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
Which is what?
I guess you have your reasons.
You want me to be your guide --?
I do?  How long will you be staying?
You should hope quite a while.
'Yes' what?
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
Where are you?  Are you there?
What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
About what?
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
How's that, Quince?
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
How did you know?
Thank God.
What is it, Daddy --?
I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
Then what will you say?
What a night.
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
Why?
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
Why not?
39.
66.
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
I'm sorry... um... ?
Couple days.
So you're holding my calls?
When was I in here?
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
A cop?
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
Sleep okay?
So I just take your word?
What?
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Don't talk about my wife.
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
Did Teddy send you?
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Shut your mouth!
Mr Gammell?
Lenny, is that you?
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
Why are you here?
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
Teddy. Your buddy.
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
You won't remember!
Why would I do that?						    *
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
And...?
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
Just came in.  She's still alive.
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
What's "nothing"?
So where's the best place for mojitas?
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
How's he not your husband?
Later!  Do you dance?
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
Hola, chica.
Would you find me...?
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
Jos...
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
Packaging?
Stevens?
Like...?
What's your take?
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
They had me from the gate.
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
Then what were we talking to you for?
I gotta, I gotta go...!
Alonzo...
You're hoping to get a look at what?
You ain't coming to work?
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
He's got taxi fare.
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
Okay. Never argue with a man.
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
Don't say nothing about you either.
Don't need a comb.
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
These guys're good drivers.
Hey -- whatsa matter?
You're what?
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
I'm going to Florida.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Gonna be like money from home.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
Get lost.
History, man, history. How much?
Want me to take over?
Nah, just covered with batshit!
Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean...  ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Where are the minefields?
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Got a family back there?
Feeling all right?
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
We go back.
What?
I want to cut his throat.
Hishradyo.
What is it? . . . Billy?
You're ayip!
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
Who?
Peter...
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
Any luck?
What are you putting that crap on me for?
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Please.
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
He was just doing his job.
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
Rub it on the windows!
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
I'm not much of a critic.
Sure.
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
You're very kind...
But what?
I can take it, go ahead.
Pretty rough so far.
My daughter must be going nuts.
I guess that means it's okay.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
I'm getting to believe you.
Yeah, thanks.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
I DIDN'T...
No big deal.
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
--cliff-hangers--
The what?
...have to wait.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
I'm almost done.
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
Could be the weight of the snow.
What is it?
Did they win?
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
Great.
From her point of view or mine?
Not much luggage.
Not exactly.  Wallis?
Ninety-three point four million.
Range is two kay.
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
Yes?
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
- you who don't have a conscience.
No.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
Why did you phrase it like that?
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
What did you think of him?
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
You mean it'll be difficult.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor..
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
She must still be on the property.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
So what did he say?
Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
To friends.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
Whats Hunt doing on the TGV?
But why tell us?
Hes putting on a show, Barnes.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
Take off your coat.
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
What are you going to do?
Its all right, Ethan..youll bring me back...wont you...
Location green.  One hour.  Ill be there myself.
Youre in Prague?
We've lost enough agents for one night.
For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
That's the question I want to ask Job.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
What sector's the air conditioning?
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
We'll see.
Ethan.  Hes out of pocket.
Would you remove your hat please?
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
Sure.  If the main character does.
- and picked us up in the States -
- no.  She cant know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Theres too much at stake, Ethan.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Ill call you from Paris.
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
Loud and clear.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
I don't wanna talk about it.
What?
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
And what did they say?
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
Why didn't he call himself?
Have you come from my brother?
Yes. Do you want...
I like it well done.
This is good. Uhh...
Loretta.
How many men since then?
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
What are you doing!
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
To the bed.
What? What have we done?
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
You don't get along with anybody!
But he wants me to come!
But that's cause he don't know!
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Alright.
Hi.
It's really cold.
How can you ask me that?
I know what I know.
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
Will you marry me?
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
How about a month from today?
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
We should talk alone.
What?
Why not?
I'm thirty-seven years old.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
Oh.
Don't make yourself sick.
Moving in?
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
Yes?
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
I'm not disturbed. By you.
Sorry. That was rude.
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
I'm a housewife.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
Yes.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
She's got it.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
Burn her anyway.
Does wood sink in water?
...What?
Where did you get the coconuts?
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
I am your king!
Well, I didn't vote for you.
The same!
Oh!
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
What?
No, it isn't.
Well, what's that then?
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Well, what are you then?
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
They're nervous, sire.
We shall attack at once.
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
It is the rabbit.
What?
Je...sus Christ!
... But all the decision of that officer ...
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
They cost fifty pounds each!
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
Do you want to come and have a drink?
I don't want land.
I was saved at the last minute.
How?
Yes?
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Until you, or anyone else ...
No, not anyone else - just me.
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
Well ...
Why?
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
They're all saying the word ...
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
No, no, no.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
Seventy a year.
How about yourself?
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
Be careful who sees it.
Mr Brown, sir --
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
Yeah.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
Whom you address.
Gesture?
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
And that is my last word on the matter.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
Nobody has any rights over me.
What do you know about the Highlands?
I'm fine.
I'm not married.
Oh.
Maybe, once.
The greasy pole.
No loyalty.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Mr Brown.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
Archie.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
I am told so.
Who by?
We took a nip of whiskey.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
Then why send me back to them?!
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
Then they may read about me.
Who?
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
What's her excuse this time?
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
We were expecting you to return by six.
Who told them that?
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
I'm in the middle of it...
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
No way.
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
It's already out.
What?
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
What are you going to do?
Dante's Inferno.
Alex...
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
What?
Our time's up.
What?!  There's nothing here!
Yes...
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.
That's impossible.
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
What do you mean "you know"?
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
You gotta be kidding?
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
I...
No, I don't.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Yes.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
No ..........I.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
You don't remember anything else?
Okay... but just...just to see.
"Really?"
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
But I want to.
Not here...no thanks.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.
Leave him, he's dead.
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
Now where do we go ?
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
Why did you build this whole place ?
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
That was eleven years ago.
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
It's fine thanks.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
But, he's...
I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.
You did.
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Fire the whole division.
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
Of course.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
What do you mean sir ?
Sir ?
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
One moment dear... 
We can't afford too many surprises.
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
Thank you very much.
As appealing as that sounds...
Are you okay ?
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
Hey buddy. You okay ?
No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.
Why don't you shut up now.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
Okay, no problem.
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
We have a baby?
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
What're you saying?
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
More than anything in the world.
Hi.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Hi.
This is really very nice of you.
Hi there...can I help you?
Give it back Nicholas!
Getting off please.
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Come and get it.
Just give it to me!!
In the tar??
What do you think?
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
What's it for?
You're a good man Nicholas.
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
I'm just tired.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
They're enormous, I know.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
Really?
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
Keep your voice down!
You are perfectly healthy.
It's still available I hope?
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Harry, I really think she.....
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
Did she ever see Vada?
Yes.
Goodnight Shelly.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
Of course not.
I love this guy! 
You never cared before.
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
Hi.
In the garage.
Are you sure about all this?
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
We'd love to hear it.
He likes her.
Can I use your bathroom first?
No.
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
Hey look at this, no feet!
It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
Where's your bike?
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
What?
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
I am not.
Go???
Woah!!
What do you want it for anyway?
Hi Vada, can you come out?
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
He can't do that to me!
I can see why.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
You've been working on this, huh?
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.

Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
Almost three.
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
And to m...
Maybe it's happy there.
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
Grand Old Opera --
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
He knows better.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
What!
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
D.C.
Where are you going?
Your brother?
How in the world did he get shot?
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
Well, he's really amazing.
Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
No.
You in music?
What kind?
Bet the sheets are grey.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
Well, can you tell me why?
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
Yes. Who's this?
I have to go.
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
Hundreds of times.
An album.
Where's Bill?
You go to school together?
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
Are we in a big hurry?
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
Thank you, sir.
Who isn't?
You been followin' the news coverage?
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Tough titty, it's mine now.
You guys stay on your bellies.
You ready, Donut?
Ready.
Whose ratings were higher?
Sorry about that.
Was what worth it?
Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.
Yeah, we have a van.
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
Just wait one fucking minute.
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
And they made the first move?
That's the way of the world.
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
How immediate is immediately?
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
And where do you keep Mickey?
How so?
Is that her real name?
Where' you goin'?
No thanks.
It sure is.
Fill her up?
Okay.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
I'll smile when it's funny.
Where's Wilma?
I don't know. He's your boy.
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Have anything in mind?
Where was your father born?
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Been over to the other mill?
Haven't seen you around, have I?
Your folks live there?
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
Hell!
How d'you mean?
You almost got into trouble back there.
What?
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
Why did you?
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
I didn't know you had one.
Okay, I guess.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
You didn't answer my question.
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Don't look so scared.
They won't.
You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
What the hell could you do?
Day work.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
What d'you mean?
There's nothing to say.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
'See ya.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
No, thanks.
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
Come on, Pop.
No thanks, Lee.
Who is?!
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
I guess I ain't.
Don't look like there's a right way.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
I understand.
I know.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
He's your son.
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
Since when?
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
What about her?
Can you get us into Straylight?
How's the villa's security?
Alright. Let's talk business.
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
Dixie McCoy
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
Right...
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
How much time you got left?
What?
I think you're full of shit.
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
Holy shit...
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
I know.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
Petty good.
 uhh, must have forgotten-
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Okay. That's bad.
Anita!
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
I think it's pronounced gauche.
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
Have you been there?
Uhh, no.
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
You having fun?
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Josie Grossie.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Wow, Josie- you look really-
You like her?
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
When are you going to open your eyes?
Oh--yikes!
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
Well, are you here with anybody?
What?
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Are you having fun?
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
Why not?
It's not the gas, Dad!
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Come back here!
I'll kill you now.
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
It was okay.
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
Anything?
What's so funny?
Okay, I guess.
Maybe we should call a doctor.
Hi, Kerry.
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
He's full of shit.
I thought I'd wait for you.
They're healing up nicely.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
What's happening?
You like gymnastics?
That was different.
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
Remember -- open mind.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
What are we going to do?
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
Okay, straight talk only in here.
Somebody else is out here.
Science...I suppose.
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
I could've saved them.
Hi.
That was such a great evening.
I'm not listening.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
Well, they can be.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Oh Jesus.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Hello.
Okay -- fine.
Floppy, huh?
I thought you were leaving.
No, I didn't.
So who left who?
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
With a goat playing a violin.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Oh please sod off.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
Stay forever.
Undressed like this, yes.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
Does the girl have a name?
He wouldn't say.
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
Bella -- this is Anna.
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Da Vinci?
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
I did.
No, it doesn't.
Definitely no comment.
So I get the brownie?
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
Hey.
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
And she's in your house.
And you get on very well.
I wouldn't go outside.
Why not?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
But you have no proof.
M-m-m-ma'am?
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
So do I!
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
God Bless America.
Yeah, Mack?
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
They went that way.
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
I'll bet a dollar.
What are you doing?
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
With your own two hands?
I'm busting outta this place.
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
I'm the coach!
No!
Who told you that?
Hit me!
My turn.
I see.
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
I don't, Doc...
Doc, what can I tell ya?
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
Yeah!
Somebody's coming!
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
Hi.
There they are!
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
Is he in an asylum?
He's dead.
Why?
No.
--separate, in the evening..."
Who's dying?
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Hello?  Is anybody there?
My name's 
WAIT!!  Where are you?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Why can't you just tell me?
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
So?
Hi, Peter.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
What?
What?...
Why are you doing this?
You okay?
Hi.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
What would you call it?
Very funny.
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
I'll look forward to it.
Yes?
Really?
Is everything okay?
But somebody wrote those songs.
But it's July.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Does Dwayne know about this?
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
So?
What is it?
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
What did you say to her?
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
I never even got to be single.
Faith--
What?
Like a detective.
Why?
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
What?
No.  No, you go ahead.
Whatareyoudoing?!
Yes.  He is.
Uh huh.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
How old are you?
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
I'm not thirsty.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the er as you put it main order of business?
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
But my own kid bro
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
Mmhmmm.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against 
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
See! You don't understand!
Why Edie, I
What makes him so special?
I think we're O.K.
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
They play pretty rough.
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
Now what are you doing?
What for?
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
Who is he, Pop?
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
But you've got to listen to me.
It started as a favor for my brother you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no a favor Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
Now don't give me a hard time.
What do you want from me, Father.
Your gun.
Give me that gun.
You go to hell.
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
Who asked him here?
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
So help me God!
Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
Give me a double.
Take it easy now, Terry.
Hey, Skins  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
So-so, Johnny.
I know, Johnny, I know... .
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
Maybe I will one of these days.
Leave her alone, you fiend!
If I could get my hands on you...
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
...And what is this?
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
I will decide the conclusion.
For what!?!
Is there time?
Aannnnaahhnn.
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
I said not as a rule.
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
Glenn Michaels.
Yes.
You didn't visit him in prison.
He didn't want me to.
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
Go away, or I'll call the police.
It's Richard Ripley.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
I'm a tourist.
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
You find out?
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
What?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
All right, but...
Leave it where it is.
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
I bet.  How much?
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Who's sitting here?
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
If I could have a little more room.
Boy, it stunk in there.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Of course I am.
Uh-huh.
We still talk, though.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
And your gun.
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
Don't leave me.
Is that how you think of yourself?
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
You like taking risks.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
You believe that?
What were you gonna do with me?
I wasn't sure you caught that.
Where?
I don't think we should get into that.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
Take your sunglasses off.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
Foley?  That you?
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
There were others.
And so now you're off to Glades.
Like what?
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
And is Foley a part of this?
Why's that?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Really?
Gimme another hint.
Me?
What-- when?
I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
What'd you fight, middleweight?
Flyweight.
Moselle Miller?
You not with probation, one of those?
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Got run over by a car.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
Oh, he's moved out?
I really gotta go.
We don't get to talk much any more.
He doesn't even look like that.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
You gonna go get him?
I told you, he isn't here.
You here all by yourself?
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
I wish she could forget him.
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
Good shooting, Rafe!
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
It's tight.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
I got a half a tank.  You?
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
How's everything?
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
Don't get smart with me, son.
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
Bombers.
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
It must of been a convincing letter.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
Do you believe in all of that?
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
I don't get it.
We're here on the sofa bed...
You drive like a maniac!
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Maybe I blocked it out.
Thanks.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
But what has to be different?
That's real big of you.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
Just take a look at it. 
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
For everyone.
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
You think so?
I thought I knew everything about him.
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
Quiet today?
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Sort of.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
What happened to you?
I don't feel very festive.
What was?
What a great kite.
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
I couldn't help it  I loved him.
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
What's the matter?
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
Wait! I'll go with you!
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
That's Renee alright.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
What did?
How long have you been here?
Mom...
In a word, Bob...
Aren't you giving an exam?
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
Ready for what, baby?
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
Thanks, Charles.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
New baby?
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Nine.
I buy that.
What's her name?
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
I'm a law suit.
I've considered that.
I know a good probate lawyer.
Particularly, Charles.
I suppose you could say that.
Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
What can I do?
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
Yes.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
In what way?
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Objection!
Leave that.
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
What kind of people?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
How many do you know?
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
You taught him a lesson.
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Charles...
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
They're coming.
One or two.
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
Don't do this to me....
Just give me your hand.
Hey, who?
So why isn't it all bloody?
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
I never said I was.
79 kilos.
We're just burnin' light here.
This does not help us, Johns.
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
Why did I fall on you?
You mean that "load" of passengers?
You know who Muhammad was?
Imam. Slow down.
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
Oh, no. No, no, no....
What're you doin'?
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
So much for your nightfall.
What, it's broken?
The best. But we won't need them.
As you wish.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
Well, maybe they're not.
Yo!
But how long is a day?
That way.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
He's trying to form words.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Don't bother
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
Who put them up?
Of course.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
I don't know.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Taylor! Tell him.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Taylor! Francis!
First time?
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
Okay - got light duty, three days.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
Must be somebody?
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
What we got here a crusader?
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
How far does this train go?
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
Well..
I'm supposing.
Not tonight.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Don't I even get my face slapped?
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
Bad enough.
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
Just who are you, anyway?
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
So have I.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
Killaine...
Well?
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
In a way.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Yes, Miss.
That's an evasion and you know it.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
Who hasn't--one way or another?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
This isn't a very good place to talk.
I don't want to talk.
I expected nothing else.
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
They call me Jeff.
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
Name it.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
You mentioned information.
A thousand.
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
The usual grind.
I never notice the view after the first week.
I wouldn't know.
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Would that make me a heel?
It could have been an accident.
Mitchell was too drunk.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
Mr. Mitchell.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
What are you doing here?
What do you want?
He saw my face too.
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
What's the face for, Driscoll?
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
So it seems Sergeant.
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
I think so.
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
May you what?
I never saw it before.
It does.  May I go now? 
I don't understand.
I'm interested in who handled it.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
What'll we do about it, Margo?
You don't have to make a pose of it.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
Thank you.
What went wrong?
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
I'm not sure I can face it.
How's Mary?
It's terribly good.
Congratulations.  Who with?
So it's all worked out perfectly...
And I didn't like that man.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
Damn.  They're early.
You don't trust me.
Jeremy phoned this morning
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
You approve!
Yes, finally.
Hello.
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
She said that?
And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
It was last year.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
I gotta be fucking crazy.
A flaw I'm working on.
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
I'm not armed.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
Did he rob it?
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
Yeah, or cashing a check.
They took a left at the next light!
Kid, get outta the way!!
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
Well, I saw you and--
Who cares!
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
What story did you give to Davis?
We're not going.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
You saw what?
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
What have you got in mind, General.
Georgia.
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Your uncle will like this.
There's no way you could know that.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
No.
What?
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
Diet coke.
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
Let's talk some more first.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
Where'd you go?
No?  Why's that?
By breaking up a company's assets --
Where'd you learn to do this?
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
All right.  How much for the week?
I got a dress, yeah.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
I think you'll approve.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Why not?
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
You always been rich?
I don't know what you're talking about.
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
You won't.
Where are you taking me!?
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
What did you do to him?
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
Oh, god, what?
What time's diner tonight?
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
We just did.
I'm up.
All this because of that whore!
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Kit...
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
Rent.  You're late.
And who is that?
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
May I help you?
Are you looking for something in particular?
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Do you remember me?
Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
But how can you be sure?
It never happened.
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
The body?
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
I brought you a special present.
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
Who won? How did it end?
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Your guess is as good as mine --
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
-- yes --
What? What?
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Because I know something you don't know.
You're amazing!
Get used to disappointment.
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
I accept.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
You've made your decision then7
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
I'm not listening.
An hour.
Think it'll work?
Congratulations.
What are you saying?
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
Good, what is it?
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
But that's cheating!
Help!
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
Yes, what?
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
But what if the play was a hit?
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
It won't run a week!
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Maybe it's not true!
What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Yes.
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
Do it!  Do it!
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
Min Bialystock.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
Like clockwork.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Ta.  Ta.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
Of Siegfried...
Nietzche...
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
Vat?
What have you done, LSD?
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
Oh, sing.  Sing!
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
No.
No! Of all...
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
What?
Cash or check? For the cabin...
Someone is sitting in that window.
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
Let's all talk about Mary.
Of course not. Please.
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...
With you.
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
Huh?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
She'll need both of us.
It's been three.
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Where's the old highway?
Probably on his way back right now.
Why can't I go out there with you?
Without calling me?
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
This is the old highway.
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
I imagine so.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
Why don't you go away?
No, not like me.
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
I'd like to, but...
Please... I'd like to go...
Why?
Went out before service.
Just coming up to ring for you.
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
They thought she'd be coming to me.
You didn't find anything.
You mean he doesn't work for you?
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
I'm going to call the police.
Yes.
No?
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
Did you? Where?
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
I think so.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
Let me go! Let me go!
What! What are you talking about?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
What!
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
What do you mean police dog?
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
He might get some publicity out of it.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
What is it? What happened?
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
I'd know him anywhere.
I'm heading out of town.
What?
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
In what sense were they bad?
Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
Don't mention it.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
I said I wouldn't.
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
I do, too!
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
What'd you say, Brother?
There goes Mother.
What are they doing, Doll?
Why is it taking so long?
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Is her husband sick or something?
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
I think we both know her.
Turn up your hearing aid.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
What time is it?
Is she all right?
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
What did you forget?
Honey!
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
Well, it was a silly question.
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
Mine.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
Well, I am working on my thesis.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Well, you run on now.
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
How much?
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
What and?  That's what I got.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
I'm just saying...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey...
Nope.
You going rogue on me?
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
We got him.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
Yeah.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
Yes, my Master.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
How are we doing?
The same as always.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
I thought she was with you.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Good shot, Red Two.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
Ugh!
Quiet.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
He's my father.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
He might be.  I don't know.
The future is ours so let's plan it.
Janet.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
Oh Brad.
"Transylvania"
Oh my, my,
Like I'm outside in the rain
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
...Fine.
Yes.
It's fine.
No, I don't belong here.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
What?
I always knew you was pretty.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
...What?
No... I can't!
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
That so.
Don't talk like that to him!
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
You busted?!
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
He won't last one round.
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
...It's very American.
...Still don't feel no heat.
Why?
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Few minutes?
How 'bout some Cokes?
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
I say ya nothin'!
What's happenin' here?
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
Ya sure?
How'd you know?
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
What?
I like yella teeth.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
What was I gonna say?
I said, how ya feelin'?
Yeah.
Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
Did ya get the message, kid?
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Real good.
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
It ain't your locker no more.
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
...What kinda dog is this again?
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
What gaps?
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
...People talk to me more.
So where is it then?
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
What was <u>that</u>?
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Sounds like singin'.
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Have you got the will?
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
Wrong number?
Yeah?
I think you oughta read it to her.
Keep reading...
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Out--
Of love?
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
Juliet!
I come for my lady Juliet.
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
[Within] Juliet!
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
I thought all for the best.
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
From Interpol?
You were a soldier, were you?
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Bad company...
What do you mean?
Where's my information?
We'll die if we stay here!
Then where is it?
Is it done?
That's it.
What are you doing?
Of course.  Don't you?
Yeah.
Created?
You seem one to me.
I ride with fat-boy...
Same thing, isn't it?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
What's going on?
It was at that.
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
I never made that claim.
You think?
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
You son-of-a-bitch...
You better get some sleep, alright?
I'm alright.  And you?
Ready to roll, partner?
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
Ten thousand right here.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
Well what are we supposed to do?
How long is it going to take?!
What are you proposing?
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
Hi.
Nothing.
Yeah I'm fine.
That son of a bitch.
And I'd take it out on him.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
So do I.
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
What?
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
What makes you say that?
I guess we can get started.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Lingerie...
Hmmm...
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
She's not his type.
Why?
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
What?
Well you're not getting, either.
You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.
Are you hungry?
Not in the trunk.
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
How much is that?
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
How'd you know?
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
Those girls drove off because of you.
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
You lied to me.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
How you doin'?
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
Where are you going?
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
I'm okay, you go.
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
Is it hot in here?
She's getting undressed.
I wouldn't do that!!!
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
Are you serious?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Red Dragon.
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
First class.
Just trying to make it look real.
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
Baby Duck?
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Tell me about it.
He was just doing his job.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
Where were we?
What about them?
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
Which one?
What a surprise!
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.
Not anymore.
I could get promoted right out of here.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
How about a lift home?
Any demands yet?
How much they want?
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
Hello.
It's Griffin.
I do.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
What do you expect me to say to this?
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
Bob's in a hurry.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
Then you'll be my best man.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
That's fair.
Twice...
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
You don't know.
No.
Of course.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
You tell Maggie.
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
Is that all right with you?
It's delicious, trust me.
Does it have wheat in it?
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
You couldn't.
Walter.
You should write something about this.
It's not true, but it feels true.
Actually, he sounded nice.
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
I love you, too.
It's a sign --
So I mailed your letter.
M.F.E.O.?
You're going to miss the train.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
I know.
I want my money.
Go home for the weekend.
Please --
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
It's me?
Grace heard it.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Who is this?
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
Have you had any relationship since?
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
You don't like the one he was now?
You'll see.
Dad, could you close the door?
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Stressed.
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
I'm starting to forget her.
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
I was thirsty.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
When I found you?
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
Okay.
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
What do you mean?
No thanks.
It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
Why are they singing, Mama?
They are singing for me.
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
Forget it.
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
What were they saying? About you? In there?
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
Be still ...
Tell me.
No. New York.
I thought maybe you forgot...
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
Not even a guess?
How about in the house?
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
Nothing.
I can't leave.
Oh. Hi.
What happened to your eye?
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
Why not?
Colette, go.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
What time is it?
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
Don't get carried away.
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
What?
But...I've seen you.
But... why? Why would you pretend?
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
You don't find that repugnant?
Cut the shit, Flynne.
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
To who?
Who the hell is Jimmy?
He's the only one I told.
What's on the other end of this thing?
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
When is the deal going down?
You think that's a good idea?
What do you mean?
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
We're in business.
Don't worry about it.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
Where are your men now?
You must be a hell a shot.
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
I'd love to hear it.
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
I wasn't made for this.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
PUSH!
Maybe.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
No, sir.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Gee, it's easy.
That's not even a scam.
What's a scam?
C'mon Lloyd.
Hang in there, man.
See you tomorrow.
Lloyd is doomed.
Meaning?
Wait a minute.
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
Visit her at the home.
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
Morning honey.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Dad.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
I'm so ashamed dad.
Hi.
Mom, please?
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
You will?
Busy?
Are you busy on Saturday?
Well...
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
So it's an honor?
Thank-you.
Have a good sleep.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
You're shaking.
Why didn't you tell me?
We decided...
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Is this because of your dad?
You do?
One more time would be nice.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
No.
How do you pay for one of those?
Seriously, Lloyd.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Very talented.
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
No way.
Hey.
Ooop, excuse me.
Certainly.
I love you man
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
Sir, the list is correct.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
It's not a charade, all this?
Should I stay?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
I'm sorry to hear that.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
He's important to my business.
You took my workers.
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
We need to talk.
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
I can do it, Captain.
thought he was doing AA.
I won't.
Yes.
And much richer as a result.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
And are the police sure about that?
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
I see you read the book.
I know that.
And Joel's pre-med.
Oh my God. How could it happen?
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
Who are you?
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
What?
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
Time to change numbers again?
That was good.
How many guys they have on you?
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
..harmonica style is okay.
She's not here right now.
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
I get scared really easy, okay.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Who is this?
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
What?!
Yeah.
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
What do you mean?
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
Yeah?
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
They found another note?
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
Sidney, what happened?
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
Your life?
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
Basements creep me out.
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
Hello.
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
It's Sarah.
W-what do you want?
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
How do I know their voices are --
No I need to call you. Just you.
Owwww...
Now that it's out of your system.
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
It's been a year since she died.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
Sshh... it's okay.
Are you serious?
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Uh-huh.
Who is this?
Do I?
Hello.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Guess.
Yes?
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
I believe you...
Where are you?
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Michael... Michael Myers.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
What brings you out to these parts?
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
Any word on my Dad?
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
Drive by patrol.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Where is she?
I'm not here to fight.
You owe my mother.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
So where are you?
Uh-huh.
LEAVEMEALONE!
...out at the airport...
Don't come any closer.
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
For about two seconds.
Besides --  "Takes a man to do something like that."
You coming tonight?
He came to make up.
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
Or a man's mentality.
It's past seven.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
So what?  This victim...
It's always been like this.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
What time is it?
You didn't know.
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
Delusions of grandeur.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
Not here.
Good.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
What about sports?
You go to movies at least?
Did you read them?
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Forced what?
And you don't?
I wish I still thought like you.
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
The fingerprints.
Why would we?
How did the fire fight end?
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
No.
How much money do you have?
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
How do you know all about this?
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
You do your job...
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
Oh, you want to stay now?
Well... what the fuck, man?
No.
Slut.
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Did the wife confess?
How's California?
It was, I tell you!
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
He cometh forth like a...
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
I say NO!
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Unnt-meah!
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
You want us to fire a shot if...
You all right, Ethan?
What you goin' to do?
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Oh...
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
She's not a little girl any more.
From the beginning...
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
She'd be about thirteen now...
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
Cherry-red Tears.
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
Where have you been all day?
How did you get me out of there?
Ellen.
Mrs. Straub!
Well, look here!
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
Really?
Lady?
You have the money?
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
The title?
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
How long has it been?
And your relations?
And his ears.
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
Will! Have you finished?
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
By God, I wish I knew.
The show must  you know
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
And yours?
Ethel.
"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
"Of love?"
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
When the Queen commands it.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
And--?
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
Better fortune, boy.
If they find you here they will kill you.
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
There is.
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
I know how to fight!
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
Nono.
Will you read it for me?
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
My lady VIOLA.
But why me?
I am going to church.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
I . . .
I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.
She sings too?
Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
Is there a man?
He made it clear.
No, not that.
I won't be able to.
I just thought we should discuss it.
Finished.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
What? Yes, that's fine.
Nothing.
I want to secure it.
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
Yeah?
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
That's right.
Oh, yes, it's great.
Know and love?
David hasn't seen him either.
What sort of car?
Alex.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
I don't want to. It's different.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
That's not him.
Hello. Hello.
I don't see the point in that.
Leave him alone.
Oh, good.
Aren't you going to answer it?
It's the only way.
You're frightened.
Alex.
I see.
What?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
No, I've never seen them.
Yes.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Are you all right?
Do you know many of these people?
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
Two hundred.
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Eh --
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
What do you do?
For what?
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
That you were just indulging me.
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
What are you talking about?
What?
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
I'll be back in a while.
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
Yes.
-- Anyway.
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
You know what I'm talking about.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
Well, are you?
I never get my hair done.
Yeah.
Right.
Wonderful woman.
She is.
Right, that's right.
You do know what money's like these days.
I've got heads here, Norman.
You promised you'd do the show.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
Jesus...
How long you had this?
Well, what do you think?
Not too much, don't cut too much.
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
No! Don't! Please!
What are you talking about?
Look, either come in or stay out!
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
-- what guy?
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
-- we can't now.
-- don't you want to --
Where do you want to go?
-- yeah.
We're friends.
-- where'd you go?
Mmmm --
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
-- we're kidding ourselves.
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
Don't go, Jackie...
No, man.
What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?
-- please, please forgive me...
-- why did you come in today?
-- yes, George.
Not yet.
Keep moving --
Now, George --
Of course I like children.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Great.
Hey, I'm, you know --
Going where?
Honey, have they offered you the job?
Look at the way I live.
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
Yes.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
Obviously.
What do you wanna know for?
-- no, it'll help me, really --
What? What? What? What? What?
That's all you've got to say?
No?
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
Tonight?
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
Oh yeah?
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Well... who are those guys?
Now wait a minute...
I wanna hear about it.
What, do you think I planned it?
Who?
What about her?
Lester, it just happened.
Yes I do.
Awww --

I'm coming over.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
And?
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
You and your touchy investors.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Oh yeah?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Well, you know what I mean.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
C'mon.
-- Yesss?
What did you do?
Oh. thank you.
Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.
You're going?
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
Jill.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
No.
We'll let you know tomorrow.
Yes, Dad.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
I can't.  I have too much to do.
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
I guess so.
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
Yeah.
Okay, Mom.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Okay...oh!
I won't make any noise.
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
To my stomach.
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Good.
Bill, how do you do?
What'll it be?
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
What do you want me to do about it?
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
He's still asleep.
As soon as possible.
Stay away from me!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay... stay away!
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
I'm intrigued.
Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?
This is our Colorado Lounge.
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
Where's Mom?
No.
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
Your mom's not around, is she?
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
What?
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
Yeah? Really?
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
SING!
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
What?
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
Yes?
HE'S SO FINE.
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
Why?
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
What is it, Mary?
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
What?
Is there any syrup?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
Bobs
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
Enough joking.
A what?
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
A what?
Your cell is more than adequate.
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
A vote?
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
But -- why?
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
And if she runs?
It's a bluff, Vince.
It's done?
Get her!
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Sister Mary Patrick?
Yes?
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
But, Bishop...
She's... she's a nun.
Many have.
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
Excuse me?
What is that?
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
I shall, gladly.
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
I manage fine alone.
Listen.
We are leaving.
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
Baltus Van Tassel.
What books?
What now?  Where is she?
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
What?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
I apologize if I worried you.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
I have not been able to face him yet.
Where are we going?
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
You are from the Hollow?
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
Yeah, they's good all right.
All right then.
Can I help you?
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
You have any biscuits for sale?
About a half a mile I think it is.
It's too big.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
What's all them books?
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
Do you like to play football?
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
Two people.
I thought they was.
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
Yeah.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
All right then.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Oh, jackin' off?
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
I want to come back and stay here.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I never was no good with history.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Yes sir.
Yeah.
I'll be.
Tolerable, I reckon.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
Naw, I ain't.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Let's just go, Marsha.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Before they were married?
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
I didn't mean that.
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
Do me a favor, will you?
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Yeah, I did.
I didn't know you took pictures.
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
They're all the same.
It's kind of overwhelming.
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
Anything good?
Ready. Any time you are.
I'm all ears.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
I mean, it's a good story.
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
What's this?
Why don't you open it and find out?
There's just one thing I want to know.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
Seventeen.
So I can get my job back.
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
It'll never be finished.
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
And you told your nephew about it?
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
Jesus.
You going to sit here all day?
It was just a thought.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Thomas.
What do you want me to say?
Yeah? And why is that?
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
Eight-thirty.
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Hey, it's you.
Where did you get that thing?
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
You don't really want to know.
And?
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Thanks. 
Celebrate? What for?
I just did.
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
I don't know.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
Well?
No wonder he was angry.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
I'm not going to do it.
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
How do you want that cooked?
Medium rare, please.
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
None.
I don't know.
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
I did.  Boy.
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
You must think I like losing.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
Apparently.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
Are these your bags?
Hi, Mary Lou - Rosella - Okay, Dolores, get a move on - How's your back, Olga?
Yes, Sue?  What is it?
Upsy-daisy.
No --- how does it go?
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
But suppose it doesn't?
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
Quiet - I'm thinking.
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
Yeah - where were you?
With you.
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
They got the bull-fiddle.
Where are we running, Joe?
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
You - you -
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
What are you doing with my flowers?
WHAT?
Hey - these are real diamonds.
Joe -
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
Terribly sorry.
Oh - Sugar!
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
Anything wrong?
I'm not that sick.
When?
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
I guess she's not in here.
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
No!
Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
You like it?
It's about the Florida job.
Please.  It won't happen again.
About that roadhouse -
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
Why?
Yes, Joe.
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
Oh.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
You are?
About what?
Want to switch berths with me?
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
You're not hurt, are you?
I don't think so.
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Which one is yours - the big one?
No, my flag steward.
I'm not interested at all.
Could be.  Do you play the market?
- opening of the Opera -
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
Oh?
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
Completely.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
Nothing at all?
What happened?
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Would you do me a favor?
Anything this time?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Me?
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
PLEASE!
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Go where?
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Why?
I sleep with my spats on.
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
I already told you.
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
Wow. You look beautiful.
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
Huh?
Moms refining her strategy for DDay.
Im an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I dont bake.
Um, just about everyone.
I thought you said you were crap.
Ill just check into a hotel.
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
But, somehow, it was Kats arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
What?
Not for a dog.
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked.
A weekend?
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?
You have had girlfriends?
So, whyd you say yes to me?
Yeah. You?
What?! No, no. You cant--
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
You didnt have to do that.
So whyd you let him go?
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
You don't live around here, do you?
Is he here in Borderdale?
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
Go on...
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
It was too dark, Daddy.
David Lee...
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
From Miss Johnson --
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
Miss Boatwright --
What is it, David Lee?
Poor creature...
So when I left, she gave me these books.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
But, Miss Boatwright, you--
Hello, David...
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Mama, what was we laughin' for?
Well, let's get to work!
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
Pillow.
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
Dude!
What is this?
<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>
What?
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
I can't believe he's dead.
You're late, Cartman!
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
Look, Eric it's your little friends.
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
Kyle?!
What's going on, Chef?
Hey, Chef.
May I?
I am Satan. I am your God, now.
Mrph mprph!!
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
What's that?
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
It's so very cold...
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
This is sweet!!
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
I thought you had something planned.
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
I am the dark master!
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
It's from your mother.
Fight the power!
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
What did you do today Satan?
You don't care.
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Hey, relax guy!
Hey, I'm missing the party!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Yeah!
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Cool!
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
Getting drunk is no solution.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
You gotta think of your old age.
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
What are we going to do?
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
And what are you going to do?!
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
No, just enjoying the view.
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
I'm looking for a man.
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
Nope.
Heh, heh, heh.
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Hey, you still here?
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
You know, Elvis bowled.
Sure, Sid.
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
Buzz Fazeli.
Need some advice, huh.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
I got a right. You're my father.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
Don't say that about my mom!
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
I gotta survive.
No...
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
Son?
It depends.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
Who's there?
Junior.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
I like the sport the way it is.
He's not here.
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
I'd rather you didn't.
No. Do You?
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
Why were you suspended?
Sheila, please.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
Nope, I couldn't care less.
Zip.
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
Theo, Buzz is dead.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Sez you!
Some unfinished business.
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
Open it, Captain!
It's burning...
I said back away.
But she's --
What if it attacks?
What was that?
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
-- dating the crash at least that old.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
She should've known better.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
You think he killed Edmunds?
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
Ted?  Captain?
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
She wired this system.
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
What was Edmunds doing outside?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
We have a library?
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
What do you mean -- not normal?
What?
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
In Edmunds' things.
In case you die, too?
Still clear?
Fixing it.
The refridgerator.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
But how?
Tarazine?
Antibiotic.
What is it, Norman?
What do you mean, different?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
How do you feel about snakes?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You tell me.
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
Is it?
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
But I have to, Norman.
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Beth!
Stop it!
C'mon --
Pussy.
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
What?
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Like what?  I'm not --
You're staring at me.
Where's it coming from?
Don't be defensive.
Nice work, Norman.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
What is it, Harry?
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
What happened to her?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
How do we decode it?
That's right.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
Missed.
No idea.
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
Meaning?
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
Does this mean what I think it means?
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
No, not anymore.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
Here come six more... grid two!
There are only three or four left.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
I found it... It's just not there.
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
Well, I practice a lot...
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
Mobile Infantery rules !
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
Where are you going ?
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Eeuch !
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
You're late.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
A lot can happen in three minutes.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Well, yeah, sure...
Hi, mom.
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
Good for you. Go find out.
Yes, sir !
Sergeant, secure the boat !
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
The Creator is that which created V'ger.
Our data is being prepared.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
Yes.
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
<U>Computer off</U>!
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
Why aren't you on board?
I want to rent this one.
Well, it had sentimental value.
You quit.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
Yes...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
Never saw the point of 'em.
Great.  Who is it...?
"Room Service!"
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
It's for your finger.
Read the card.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
Start?  This isn't a good time.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
<u>Please</u>...
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
That's right...
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
No, that's true.
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
Gosh, you look nice.
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Not without a rolltop desk.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
Where have you been...
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
Mornin, sister.
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
How old are you?
What else?
What I...
You do...?
What's his name?
I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat.  <u>My</u> thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now:  what is this you want <u>Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars</u> to do what you're being paid to, you already <u>signed</u> you'd do...?  What is that?
You have no right to...
Why?
But we...
Will you help me out...?
I just...
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
And you know what...?
I...
Hello.
Why not?
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
What's in the case?
How about that.
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
Sure.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
<u>Siddown</u>!
<u>Stop</u>...
Is that one hell of a kid?
Do something.
...we don't have thirteen at table...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
I want them thrown in jail.
She coulda done better than him.
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
...we can't lose the wind...
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
I don't care.
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
Like who?
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
...why do you think?
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
Here.
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
That's so weak.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
You do NOT run out on your moth...
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
You touched it.
Queen of diamonds.
Poof!  You're happy now.
Rachel's job is she works.
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Mommy?
That I do.  Always will.
I'm fine, ba...
You have the WORST flu since...
Ben where do you have to get to?
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
Okay.  These are good.
But you can still see him.
You say that like I don't know that.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
Napalm.
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
Yet another spaghetti night.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
Get out!
But it's not on the schedule!
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
So.  Hopeful.
Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
It's the same choice you made.
Is that what he told you?
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
You'll learn.
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Rache, it may take time.
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
Oh.
Thank you.
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
He wasn't.
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is seriousBut don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
Ready for tomorrow?
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
What do you want?
What DO you know?
Hello, Vi.
It's over there.
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Ni...
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Hello?
Toby Oxman.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Great. How old are they?
Gee, your Dad's smart.
Is it loaded?
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
Hey, um, Toby? I was wonderingIs the documentary almost finished?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Is he with the girl?
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
What happened?
Now what?
Because I'll be firing at them.
That's it!  Up ahead!
Well?
Good.
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
Who's Ryan Cooper?
So, what are we looking at White?
What do you mean?
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
What's happening at the waterfront?
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
We can't--it's power driven!
Possibly some coffee?
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
I know nothing of the sort!
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
My seven body orifices????
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
General Schmuck?
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
Well, Mister President.
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
This is General Ripper speaking.
Why do you think I ask?
Plan-R????
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
Yes, sir.
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
I suppose they are, sir.
How much soda, sir.
Ask away, Major.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
Right.
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
And you'd like to see that?
To peace on earth, Major.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
He says they've only shot down three planes.
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
What?
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Roger.
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.
I think they mean business.
No, this looks like the real thing.
Primary circuit is live.
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
I asked you a question, Lothar!
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
But who would be chosen?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Intense.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
That was really great.
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
Sounds like a bummer.
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
What?
Don't let 'em fight.
No, he's not with a girl.
I'd get bored.
Ah!
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Am I fucking him?
Hey! Hey.
I can come visit?
It's okay.
Please.
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
You make videos?
I could.
Yeah.
Yeah. So, what about you?
Really?
It's a mistake to think that.
Taking care of business.
Oh, sure.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Mm.
Can you tell me what happened?
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
Yeah, fuck 'em.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
Will you just put the gun down?
Nazeer what?
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
You could've come over.
I hate that.
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
So you can give me more shit?
It was a racial incident.
I would've stopped it.
My goal is to make art.
Yes, you do.
Come on.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Sorry.
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
Hey, where's Erica?
Camel jockey.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Look at you!
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Yeah, come on, play it.
I can't believe you're still here.
Is that Jeff?
Oh, How'd she get back?
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
Don't do that.
Yeah?
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
She thinks you went to the police.
Yeah.
Jack, I think I should get a job.
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
Oh no...
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
You want us to help you pick up?
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
You got that big retarded girl down there?
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
Thank you.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
We're engaged.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
Who's who?
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
Nice job.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
May I say you smell real special.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Why not?
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
Her own movie theatre.
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Just a minute, you!
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
I'll take care of that.
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
Who?
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
Where are my cigarettes?
How did it go?
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
Yes, I am, Norma.
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
Wanted what?
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
No?
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
Home?
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
Hmmm?
I did.
Well, there's several ways to go .
I don't want your help.
You vicious--
Guess! Go on.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
I've got things to do.
Do you have any theories about last night?
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
You see, a tree is a living thing.
I'd rather not talk about it.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
No, MR. Danvers.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
Where is inner space?
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
What? Palace? Hardly.
Zaltar, please help me.
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
Why?
Goodbye...
There's no vodka in it.
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
The kid needs a man to show him --
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
Too much mayonnaise?
Who?
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Me??
Kent!
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
A television set?
Gus?
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
And do nothing. Just sit there.
We've already got some.
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
How you doing down there?
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
We gonna crash?
We back in Metropolis?
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
I can't see anything.
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
It could make weather!
Small potatoes.
We already have a super-tanker.
So?
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
So far the hostages are unharmed.
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
Who ????
I'm listening.
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
What else could I do?
Lois, someday --
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
But . . ..that's terrible!
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
Good. My heart can't take it.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
I think he said a "curl."
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
To ski?
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
You said it. Three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
You're late. Very late.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
I'm sorry to see you go.
. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
An angle?
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
But why the hair?
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
The one Superman wrecked up?
Hey! Just remember I made you.
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
But . . . how could you beat him?
Nobody else.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
One of them should've been you.
I've been on the job.
It was hot, yes.
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
Not unless you can fly.
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
You and your real estate.
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
I read the article.
Ready?
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
Tea?
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
I came to talk to you.
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
Please...
Is that real enough for you?
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
They'll soon be over.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
We're...not together.
Which clinic?
She didn't.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
How is Nicole?  Is she around?
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
What are you thinking?
Good night, Billy.
Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.
About the Ottos?
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
What do you mean?
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
Yes.  He does.
Excuse me?
It's for the school bazaar.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
Yes.  It's a present.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
It's like a song.
Nicole?
The people in the town?
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.
I don't want you to lie.
She...she was a friend of mine.
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
You always think you're prepared for these things.
Almost three.
DADDY!!!
Yes.
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
Who did they get for that?
How does the family survive?
What time in the morning was this?
No.
You remember that much?
Why were you scared?
Why not?
There wasn't time?
Very slick.
What are you up to, Nicole?
But Charlene...
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
No, I wouldn't...
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
I know Manny Davis.
Match me, Sidney...
You print them, don't you?
I didn't say that, J.J.
You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
How?
He means that much to you...?
And who's feet is she on now?
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Don't go wild, Sidney.
You're incapable of the truth...
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
And where was his wife?
But...
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
What's the matter?
Why not you?
You're talking very fast.
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
I tried to reach you twice -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
You haven't told him yet...
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
You going to work all day?
No good.
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
My mission is to protect you.
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
Why?
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
Swear.
Affirmative.
Pain causes it?
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
She intends to change the future somehow.
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
Easy money!
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
Are you afraid?
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
I guess so, sir.
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
What's not right?
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
Did you call someone you knew?
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
Your guess is as good as mine.
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwngler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
Then you are wrong.
Tell me about von der Null.
Yes, I know who he is.
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
I have no idea.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
Show you?
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
What?
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
Yeah?
Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
He did?
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwngler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwngler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
You were in insurance before the war.
They said I was dogged?
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
Do you understand?
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
I want it to be over for you.
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
A girl.  You know.
It's better that way.
What are you doing?
And who was the enemy?
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Why were the other two women killed?
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
Give me the short version.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
Same shit.
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
The stock will turn.
Did you play recently?
I apologized, I offered to help.
What <u>is</u> your problem?
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
There goes a thousand dollars.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
What?
I don't know.  A lot.
Who is it?
What... what do you mean?
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
They won't...
Where'd you get that... ?
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
Shut up!
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Like... where are you from?
Big family... small?
Hey there, Nickie.
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
You're part of it...
Yeah.
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
Humor me with specifics.
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
Where?
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
It was a different floor then...
Didn't I give you two?
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
I wasn't expecting you.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
Why?
Well, this lot is full!
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
All night?
You used the wrong test.
It's still an electric shock!
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
What did it smell like?
And then what happened?
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
I don't know.
It was a stupid thing to do.
It was.
What?
Get a blanket!
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
Mrs. Dudley.
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
I love this house.  I really love this house.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
That's so sad.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Is that a problem?
As soon as you get dressed.
Italian?
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
Let him break - he likes to break.
No reason.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
Did Jenny know?
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
Huh?
He's brought in the heavy mob.
Too easy?
Really.
Didn't get it.
Not her brand.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
Footloose and fancy free.
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
You don't seem bothered.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
I don't believe it.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
You sure?
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Yeah.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
I don't know.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
Something's on.
You bet.
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
Where is he, then?
-- You know his name is Frank.
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
Thanks.  You, too.
Ann--
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Who?
Hello, Birdy.
Oh, Mr Crane--
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
You're an enthusiast.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
I'll have it in a week.
...Was that a pass?
Maybe.
Yeah.
How ya doin', Ed?
...That's quite a wife you got there.
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
...Ed, I...
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Will anyone else say they knew?
...I don't get it.
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
Yeah.
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
I'm fine. Thanks.
Ed, how're you holding up?
Yeah.
Yeah.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
...You sure, Eddie?
...You ever wonder about it?
What the--
...How you today, Ed?
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
Huh?
Mr...?
His eyes are open.
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
Someone broke into this room.
Hurry up!
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
What doors?
Who are you?  The undertaker?
We need light in here, stat.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
What happened to them?
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
I don't believe it.
A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
What are they?
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
They were yellow!
They've got something.
Oh... my... God!
Margo, you haven't heard?
That's impossible.
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
My God.  Then it was an animal.
What happened?
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
Genetic damage?
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
Is there another way around?
Help someone!
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
Who are you?
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
Why not?
Nursery?
Sorry, I'm way behind.
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
This is where it started.
I was hoping we could have a special evening.
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
What're you doing down here?
Arrah!
Truman, what about that sign?
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
Well, I made it through another night.
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
You got it.
Now what?
Is there any way around?
They're going to stop me talking to you.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
Does what?
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
You've been back to Dallas?
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
What is it you find incredible?
How can this be?
Who?
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
How'd you find me?
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
Before the bomb went off?
What's wrong, Scully?
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
Scully, I found the bomb.
Why?
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
Why are you whispering?
What did you find?
Evidence of a massive infection.
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
What?
-- of what exactly?!
Mulder --
What do you think it is?
Scully....?
What? What's wrong?
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
About the conspiracy?
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
Why are you telling me this?
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
How?
What alien environment?
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
Sing a song of sixpence.
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
Agent Novak?
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
What difference does it make...?
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
Already there.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
Instead of going into his mind...
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
Awaiting his arrival.
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
What else do we do?!
Give her some cigarettes.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
...at all.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
What's she talking about?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Do I...
Gestern bein heurigen...
Tell me about him.
...to steal my girl.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
Let's not get into any more trouble.
What happened to your hand?
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
Oh, the usual things...
...anyway?
They're Harry's.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
I said another man was buried in his place.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
I don't want it.
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
Yes.
My name is Calloway.
See much of him before that?
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
Fifty yards right down there.
I said you win.
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
What is it, Sergeant?
Who?
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Striptease, sir.
Hello, Harry.
You've got plenty of contacts.
Vinkel.
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Kurtz.
Yes.
You don't mean that doctor?
What else did he tell you?
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
Everyone ok?
She is gone!
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
You think?! Based on what?
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Who the fuck are you?
Do we have to listen to this shit?
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
I don't care about money.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
Bigger and better.
Who's Linda?
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
What do you care?
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way.
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
No. What are you looking for?
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
What'd you say?
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
Did you see how they reacted to him?
More cultural than political.
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
Of course they're Jews.
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
How do you reconcile the two?
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
Think about your father. Your sister.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
Balint?
How have things been going?
Fine.
What about chicken?
Steve...
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
"Do chickens give milk?"
Leary?
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
We tested the new bomb.
What kind?
Did the driver really freeze?
What's happened??
I tell you she's mine!
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
Roberto?  How long?
Yes?
The medics are looking all over for you.
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
The rules are the rules.
What's with the voice?
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
You're the best, Enzo!
No.
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
Good night.
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
Can I come in?
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
No!  I would never cheat you.
How can you tell it's a female?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
Hello?
I didn't dive.
Jacques...?
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Assassin!
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
Again?
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
Will he understand Spanish?
Wait!  Professor...?
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
There won't be any need for that sir.
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
I want you to talk dirty to me.
We do!
What are you doing here?
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
Cool. What's it do?
Hammer, you alright?
Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Mmmyes.
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
They don't say it to me.
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Who?
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
That's right, of course.
You know Charlie How-Come?
It was you, Galbraith!
State hunters?
That's a fact, isn't it?
That's easy. Me.
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
I don't know  a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
It must be the altitude  you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys --
	As long as my feet held out.
Aint nobody out there, Mister.
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brothers death.
Its a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. Im told it retails at around 4,000.  I see you dont require a definition.
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You dont mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is hes either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But Ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why Im here at such a late hour. I need 20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
Laurence!
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Yes... You woke me up... Its the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. Youd have been ready for me when I turned up with Sleeping Beauty. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. Not Leon, you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didnt say My God!, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. Not Leon. Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman Id stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at 15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didnt you?
I dont.
Is there anything to understand?
You bastard...
Five years of it. Surely, youd have divorced him if he disgusted you?
Something like that?
Where is that?
Dont you believe in simplicity?
To get me killed...?
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
Get to the point, will you...
What do you suggest?
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
Okay. The woman just cant walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why cant you go to your Embassy?
A recent acquisition. Weve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flats been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Friedmans dead... They killed him...
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
Italian? The Mafia...?
Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this!
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
Emily...
Im calling about the puppies.
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
What about an untrained pup, white...
Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
No... No...  I swear...
Whats the Ambassador?
B-Black...
How are you, Jane?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe its there with...
Your secretary, huh!
Didnt you say I came recommended?  Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
I take it your son is called Leon?
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
Im sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
Lets go.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Huh... Im sure thered be lots of takers.
Have you?
You thought wrong. I havent seen Leon for months.
Thats what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldnt take on another child, that hed get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasnt listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think hes back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some peoples minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leons. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
Im afraid I dont understand.
Do you know Leons parents names?
I cant think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. Whats your sisters number?
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leons Austrian was looking for you I reckon hed have found you before I did.
I hear youre looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leons gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
What about which girlfriend?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Fuck...
Three...
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. Its wrong. Fucking wrong.
They lost their son. Why?
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, Id watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The ladys also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Very funny. Can I go on now?
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
Better today than tomorrow.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Jeanne, stop it!
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
What did the king say?
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
I -- I don't understand...
Jeanne's alive!
No...
I can't read.
Do you have a sword?
Quite a few.
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
W-w-what are you doing?!
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
God defeated the English, not me.
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
Praying.
Yes.
What did it tell you?
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
You will??
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
I'm... I'm not the king...
What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
If there was, I didn't see it...
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
That's not a lot.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
Yes... they were.
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
Clear?
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
I... submit to Our Lord.
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Yes... a half-steed... white.
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
What have you done to me?
Who... who are you...?
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
They're going to come and visit you in here?
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
What do you mean, they won't come?
Yes... lots of things!
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
Are you going to leave me too?
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
Then... why are you here so often?
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Why did she have to die?
Only God knows the answer to that.
Who are you?
Wladek, please.
He'll be back before curfew.
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
That makes a change.
Otherwise what?
Wladek! How are you?
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
I was listening, Kitten.
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
In the attic.
What's all that gunfire?
What about you?
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Szpilman.
Careful! Watch his hand.
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
You'd have to organise it up here.
I don't want to learn.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
She wants it to come.
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
All of it.
What?
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
There's always a depression on.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
Who's got the contract?
Yes sir.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
Then you'll do it?
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
The wire is ten years outa date.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
But I got a train to make.
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
You got a back door to this place?
No.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
We missed him.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
Said he stole his invention.
Dorothy!
I didn't.
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
He didn't do it -- Nick!
Yes.
Not that scrawny little....? 
Yes.
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Your father?
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
You heard about Julia Wolf?
There. 
Where did you hit her?
Where did you get this gun?
It's been the same one for three months.
What would your mother say to that?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
It's a promise?
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
But it isn't bad weather now.
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
I think we're on the right track.
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
You mean that body-----?
Shut up.
I see.
No.
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
What are you going to do?
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
I don't like him.
Don't you remember....
I can't! I haven't got it!
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
Well, don't you?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
You did... where?
All right - you didn't.
Why tell me?
Why do you say that?
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Isn't that my drink?
They were kidding you.
Someone get a doctor.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
Yes.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
You dog!
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
What do you mean?
He was down in the shop.
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
How long has he been dead?
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
I'm sorry...  but...
I'm fired.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
What are you doing.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
For climbing.
All right.  Let's get out of here.
What do you figure it to be?
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
What are you doing?
At-at-at-at-at.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
Now this is war.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
You're not losing trust, are you?
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
Wait.
What?
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
We'll find our way.
Forget Wes.
Wes is dead!
First Wes, now you?
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
Sure.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Can't you--
To where?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
Well?
Epps.
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
What does that mean?
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
It doesn't mean anything.
What!?
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
Think we can make it?
You down?
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
I can't hear him.
Stress category.
I'm not hungry.
Now?
Look,dirt!
What?
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
Are you all right?
They don't know.
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
Well?
Why are you so concerned?
Maternity ward, huhh!
I don't know.
What was that....
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
No......  She's dead THX........
I'm sorry.
They're not here.
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
Treat. We treat devices.
Anything else I should know?
Oh yeah? Prove it.
You mentioned something called Redstone.
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
I don't know.
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Whadaya mean?
Computer device?
What do ay say?
Jesus...
Alex-
What is that?
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
You don't fish.
Mike...
T.J., what're you doing?
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
About tonsils.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
The type they marry.
Yes, Baron.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
I hope you find the figures correct.
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
Otherwise I'll call the police
What do you mean?
Please.
No, thank you.
Right.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
He recognized you!
Correct. Now the train leaves--
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
Oh! You didn't read it!
M'sieu Laval!
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Then lunch in the Bois--
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
You look beautiful.
That's true.
No--I'm sorry.
The ship will sink.
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
Holy shit.
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
The partners want to know how it's going?
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
She's not on the starboard side either.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
Almost as good as you.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
How cold?
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Well, here you are.
Yes, exactly!
It is that simple.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
A mistake?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
You're right. Only you can do that.
You're trembling.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
You jump, I jump, right?
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
I'm sorry.
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.
Would you like anything?
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
It's so unfair.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
We'll save you a place at our table.
You'll excuse me. 
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
Brett is the name.
Don't rub it in.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
A little.
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
You can live that down, can't you?
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
Nix, the law!
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Change?
Inspector McKinney.
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
How about you?
I'll go with you.
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
Here's your fifty.
Sure.
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Yes--Me--in person!
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
And you've put it over--haven't you?
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
So what?
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
About twelve hundred.
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
You leave the kid alone.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
There you are, sir.
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
Then why did you run away?
God damn son of a...
Isn't that a daisy?
What d'you think of the singer?
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
I'm retired.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
This brand.
Forget it.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
Credat Judaeus Apella.
That's just my game.
Here, Doc.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
Ignore her?
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!
Colorado's closer
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
You'd die for fun?
I laugh sometimes
Where do you get these questions?
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
That what you got me up here for?
Forget it, Ringo.
Florentino!  He's getting away!
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
Look pretty rough.
I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face.  I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture.  That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
What about all these saloons?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
How did you get this number?
I see.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
What - no lust for adventure?
Your new car. 
Yes -
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
Is this another one of your games?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
What about the uranium?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Political considerations?
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
She married a hockey player.
They point, I shoot.
Thanks.  Take care -
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
No?
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
Blood or Dutch?
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
If not?
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
Who's in charge here?
What's your name?
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
No -
The Queen invited you to dinner -
How is it now?
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
You have to leave -
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
I don't know. He's not in the database -
What did your wife get her?
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
Will you still get the money from your father?
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
Do you think you won?
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
Those boys never did have good luck.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
What's a toby?
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Where was the last place you left him?
Hey!  Wow!
What are you doing over there?
You can't!
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
That's why.  Sid.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Don't tell me what to do!
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Hi!
MOM!!  MOM!!
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
ROOAAAARR!!!
They're getting bigger.
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
W-w-w-we?
I'm red this time.
He's a pyjama case, really.
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
I want to go home.
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
Stop it!
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
Everything is gone, now.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
I think she's lying.
This is different.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
Caroline --
What's up?
Just watching you.
You all right?
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
Sixteen
How are your grades?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
Chill out --
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
Arizona.
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
You will help me with my other problem.
I'm aware of that.
It could mean that, yes.
It's possible.
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
Diane.
Sorry.
Easy for you to say.
Can I see you again?
Happy birthday.
So, what's he like?
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Clear?
Right.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
Fuck you.
I can't believe you did that.
Four Grand.
We're two thousand short.
The Sick Boy method.
With a starship!
He has his doubts...
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Admit it. We're lost.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Where did you get this power?
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
MM.?
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
Be one with the horse.
You must allow us to act.
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
A "t."
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
What is this?
What are you doing?
About the ship...
The ship needs its Captain.
No conditions.

Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
Spock?
Sybok, we must find a way...
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
How's it going upstairs?
Did you say Group 7 access?
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
What's that?
You're alive!
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
But-what if I can't...?
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
The Users...you really think they're still there?
That's all going to change, Yori...
How?
You've grown, big program.
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
Okay, Dad.
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Harry!  Where are you!
Harry?  HARRY?!
What's this for?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
You tell on me, I tell on you.
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
Yes sir.
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
It's certainly... dramatic.
Yes.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
What did happen?
Why did you continue to see him?
No.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
No.  But I wanted to.
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
What are you going to do?
Oh shit.
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Hello?
I'm sorry, I can't.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
We're going to Paris?
I don't know.  I have to think...
It's a good thing you pay me well.
Find out who this Renquist it.
Who is this woman?
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Sure. Why not?
What time is it?
'Bout twelve.
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
Very much. Now, where were we?
What's that?
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
That dazzling imagination.
I don't believe so.
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
You wanna get unhaunted?
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
I'm her husband.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
I'm a married man.
What?
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
I certainly hope so.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Elliot Blitzer.
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Two guys.
Clarence...
Clarence.
No. But thanks.
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
The police department?
No. No, you don't.
He wants to talk ya.
No.
I can see what you mean.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Thank you very much, Clarence.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
We grew up together.
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
What makes you think I could do that?
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
Who is he?
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
Keep it.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
I've seen him.
What are you talkin' about?
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
On their honeymoon.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
That was very good.
Uh-huh.
But a fuckin' baggie.
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
You do.
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
How do you know? You been there?
No.
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
July.
What year is it?
What?
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
What made you think that?
Give me the gun.
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
You... you left them a message?
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
They hurt you!
What...???
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
You really want to know?
Might be tight.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
It's nonsense.
Where to?
One way.
Nope.  Darrell.
Accident.
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
You believe that?
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
You got beer?
I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
For the love of God would you two give it a rest?  Lord almighty.  In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic.  How far did you think you were going to get with this?  Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  Now use what little smarts you got.  If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.
You didn't hear something?
I don't know your real name.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
You're not from around here, are you?
Still playing?
Doesn't the heat bother you?
I can't.
Jake.
From?
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
I wanted to talk.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Because I know you're full of shit.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
What was I supposed to do?
I don't know.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Yeah.  Good thinking.
One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
No.  I swear it.
Someone will find me.
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
I'm her husband.
Husband . . .?
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
Why would I kill her?
No.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
And for that you'd kill Grace?
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
You know what I mean.
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
What?
Oz.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
But you was going to fight for me.
How old are you?
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?
But, Senor--
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
You expect me to believe that?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Mister!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Who the hell are you?
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
I do.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
Come on, Jake --
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
But you was going to fight for me.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
What the hell are you talking about?
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Will he be back soon?
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
You've been there?
What?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
I want my car.
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
No.
I call the sheriff.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
I don't know your real name.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You'd never understand.
Try me.
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
You don't have any money put away, do you?
I wanted to talk.
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
Why?
My mother died in this canyon.
Hope is a four-letter word.
Can you make it back up?
That's a nasty cut you got there.
"Arkady"
But, in particular?
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
One way, or round trip?
Let me get your change.
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Help me, Grace, help...
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
How old is Jeb?
What did I say?
What about Jeb?
He's asleep.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Yes. Is this David?
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
I don't know Megan.
Skeptical about what?
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
Have you ever tried to develop it?
I have to go now.
Are you finished?
He's doing well today.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
No Jeremy.
I'll just shoot him once.
He doesn't look very threatening.
How are you feeling?
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
Is this a religious thing?
I fined 'em instead.
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
Are you really going to kill them?
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
Books. He's my biographer.
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
No?
Yeah?
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
I could run off them whores.
Like I said, I...
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
The... Duck of Death.
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
But he was called...
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
William Munny, yeah.
I could of... easy.
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
Did you kill him?
He ain't killed.
When we gonna double back?
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
Tell me right off if you see him.
Yup.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
I can't see 'em.
Yeah, I guess so.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Two weeks, I guess.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
HEY.
You're marking us, Bill.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
Who's he?
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
See that scrub oak yonder?
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
Goddamnit.
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
What is it Keaton?
Keaton, I can't just -
How are you, Keaton?
You know damn well, dead-man.
What about Redfoot?
I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
That was all Fenster and McManus.
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
Then why didn't you help him?
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
You're joking.
I'm fine.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
What does it mean?
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
And what did your team do...
...We did everything we could...
Objection, we've...
Objection!
No.
I'm just an M.D.
What book is that?
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
Yes.
Why is that?
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
That's what I'd planned to...
...What difference would...
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
... and you're going to do that?
) I'm sorry ...?
Then why don't you testify?
My client can't walk, your Honor.
I need an extension for my case.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Overruled...
Mr. Galvin's...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
They, uh, they got to my witness.
I've got to work...
I've got to work.
And it's over...?
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
I have to talk to you.
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
... now who is that ...?
Are you out of your mind...?
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
What?
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
You got a good memory, Franky.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
The broad has disappeared...
...four years ago...
... I understand ...
She told me.
I want to buy you a drink.
It's a long road that has no turning.
We, we were rather busy...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
Yes.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
I -- I --
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
My name is John Ferguson, and --
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
You won't have to.
I want to know who you are.
Why?
No, you don't owe me anything.
Because I remind you of her?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
I'll take care of you.
No.
Why?!
Scottie, what are you doing?
They're none of them right.
Mmmm.
Come here.
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
Can't you see?
I need you.
You can't. You're afraid!
Your accident...
When?
Oh... wandering about.
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
Wandering about.
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
What?
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
I hope we will, too.
Shopping?
No.
Where?
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
Take me away from here?
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
Yes --
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
I know. Everybody tells me.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
From that music.
Well?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Sorry, old man. Work.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Who?
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
I've told you enough.
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
How soon can it be altered?
I didn't hear you.
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
What did you say?
The hell you do.
There's more.
Bury her out in the desert.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
At the seven-eleven.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
If anything ever happens to me...
No way.
Well, oh...
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
What is it?
Yup.
He's too drunk.
No.
Shut up.
I'm talking about prayer.
He's cracked up.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
Okay fine.
True.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
Israel doesn't have a King.
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
Not really, no.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
May we have the rings please?
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Yes.
You can't play around with these tent people.
What else have you forgot?
What?
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
He's a great chef.
Not padded ones.
Honey I don't have the time...
I need your help.
Do you love me?
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
That's sweet.
Are they fighting?
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Can we just talk this out?
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
I won't even discuss it.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
What kind of stupid question is that?
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
He kept saying he was protected.
So what do we do?
No...
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
Greenpeace.
Yeah?
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
No, the children sleep with me.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
Yes, it is.
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
You believe me, don't you?
Fifteen yards.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
So, Ramona!
How in hell does it wind up?
I don't know, sir.
And this chest?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
Do they worry you that much, then?
Are they going to work here too?
Where?
Mother?
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
Forgive me if I have offended you.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
Hello.
How did you see me?
It was very wellhidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
You son-ofabitch, I'm going to kill you.
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
What the hell happened?
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
My God...
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
I am beautiful, aren't I?
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done.
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
What are you doing?
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
What did you do to those people?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
You don't know?
You and me have nothing in common.
What are you talking about?
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Don't you want to know if it's true?
<u>Do</u> it...
Precisely.
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
In the yellow ribbon.
...can we see the Kitten...?
...what's the Long View?
Get on this, right now...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
Due in Nashville.
...I just missed my plane.
Oh, God...
Oh, Lord....
Wilfred.
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
...where is my pill?
This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day.
Where is he?
Well, c'n we get him back home?
Heavy weather East of here.
To preserve their Way of Life.
It can be documented that he displayed the...
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
Dartmouth
When's he coming back...?
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
Is that true?
I never won an Oscar.
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
Three-o-three...
What is it?
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  <u>Isn't</u> he...
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...? Hel...?  I'm going to need an <u>ambulance</u>, we take him, the last moment, right from the Pl...no, <u>we</u> land, we puttem <u>in</u> the ambulance.  Air force jet lands, we take somebody <u>else</u> off <u>that</u> jet...what the fuck do <u>I</u> care? Somebody in a Hospital gown.  And we need a ......hello?  Hello...?
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
...what happened...?
...but...
No.  You're right.
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
I have the White House on the Line.
Public Domain.
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
I'm just talking about the Hats.
A wider option of what?
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
Oh really.
Grand Marnier.
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
It concerns his future!
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
Then get out and close it behind you.
The stock's going to Pluto!
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
Alright. Why so pissed?
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
Another cup of coffee?
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
So you're hot on this stock?
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
Oh no, no...
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
Know the name?
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
With Mark?
He still likes you
About what?  About us.
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Would you like a closer look?
Your books Master Loftmore
Thank you Jenkins
And uh, your nicotine sir
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Can this be stopped?
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
Yes?
It's only two hours away.
That's not true.
I started seeing things.
Who's idea was it?
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Do you have any idea who she is?
What?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
Your friend saw them.
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
That's not...It's not like that.
And then you weren't there.
You must think I'm pathetic.
No.  No, I don't.
You know where she is?
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
They're calling me in to work.
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
Do we have to?
Kambucha mushroom tea...
It's niiice.
Know what I think?
Nothing's happening.
I think so
I'm a terrible friend.
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
Claire, I have to show up for the--
It's today?
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
Well, that's nice.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
What?  No.  No.
What?
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
Our house.
When?
I don't need a shrink.
What?
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
Not personally.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
The...
Oh God...
She's gone.
What?
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
Are you alright...?  You look pale.
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
Rowan.
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
What is it...?
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Explain this to me --- violated...?
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
Harder...
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
What else did you see- Michael...?
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
Hello...?
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
What about your work back home...?
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
Mm-hmmm...
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
You did that, didn't you...?
Something's wrong with you.
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
OH MY GAWD!
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
And it can't be forged?
This must be one of the old keys -
What's with all the locks - and hammering
Oh, about six years since I graduated
You don't know?
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
Tell me about your wife...
What didn't you like about her?
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
Don't you want me now LESLIE
Well, what do you think?
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
Dr STECKLER?
ANGEL...
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
So far away? In Xenia?
Take a whiff of heaven.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
Let me get this straight...
What gives, Don Corleone?
Yeah?
Ted, have you lost your mind?
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
So that's a maybe?
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
I mean, what do you think?
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
God, you are so hot.
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
I-I don't have the keys.
You do know how to drive?
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
Teddy? I was thinking.
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
Can you believe that was me?
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
If you could just sign right there.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
I miss them, too.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
Me-ow.
I'm trying to help.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
Where are we going?
I doubt it.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
Well? Where the hell are you?
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
What about you?
I see.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
Like what?
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
You called the cops on us?
You do like girls, don't you?
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
What are you doing?
Kelly.
She's going to wash your Jeep?
How soon can we get something?
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Did you try to fight him?
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
I've got that two o'clock in town.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
You saw the news today?
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
What was that?
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
Thank you, Jimmy.
A ride.  You want one?
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
What are you looking at?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
Do it to ourselves?
And you believe her?
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
Come on, let loose!
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
That's cop bullshit.
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Sam, for godsake.
I had to go look for this coupon.
Yes.
Yes.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
How...
No.
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
So... what happened?
Uh... how long ago was this?
Know what this is?
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
And people are actually fooled by that?
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
My God!  He's so excessive!
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
My.  It's gotten longer.
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
Easy now.
I beg your pardon?
They're coming.
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
I can't.
Sorsha.
Who is that girl, anyway?
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
You all right?
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
Patience, Willow.
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
I thought I was the English.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
It's been a while.
Have you got your gun on now?
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
Where are you taking us?
No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
Home.
Enjoying your reading?
Anything against zippers?
I know what he said.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
I hear you.
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
You admit you're lying?
I don't know where he is.
Yes, thank you very much.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
What's so funny?
God, Fred...
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
That has no place in this house.
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
They are English. They don't understand.
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
If she...
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Who are you?
...didn't you?
Oh, please give me back my dog!
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
Are you ready now?
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Now you're seeing reason.
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Where do you want to be oiled first?
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
And bears!
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
Because I'm still scared!
Oh, come on.
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
Who at?
I haven't slept in weeks.
Dorothy!
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
It's a whatzis?
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Yeah --
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
What happened to Len Tashka?
Makes her look even more innocent.
Who?
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektras ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
Consider me ungrateful.
He was my father.
Im sorry.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Im not sure he knew that.
Who is he?
What is it?
I have to go.
What the hell are you doing here?
I understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didnt have to sleep with you to find that out.
One... last... screw?
You, of course. I need some information.
No!  Get me out!
The parcels in the post.
Any word from him?
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
No idea who's behind this?
God isn't there to do it.
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
You're the only human being I care for.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
The missing scientists.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
And what if youre wrong?
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
What happened?
No comment.
Did you know he was back on the streets?
Their real names, please.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
What is this place?
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
How will you fix it?
Whatchu doing here?
You do everything Yorgi says?
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
You can't talk to it?
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
This is your standard dart gun.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
You're serious?
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
Nice hops.
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Help me with this guy.
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
Very nice. I'm impressed.
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
What's wrong with him?
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
By reading my thoughts?
He takes himself seriously.
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
The intention of registration act -
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
Is it enough?
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
What in God's name are you doing?
Is it that music?
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Hello...?
And your passport?
Yes.
Promise??
I promise.
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Does that mean you love me?
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
It seems fine.
What?
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
I'm sure we will.
Why are you talking like that?
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
What wockers?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Could be worse!
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
Cold!  Cold and dead!
I'm a failure.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
It wasn't me.
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes...yes, you have yours.
Yes, I will.
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.

Yes, sir, name, please?
An historical moment, Gentlemen.
Yes.
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
