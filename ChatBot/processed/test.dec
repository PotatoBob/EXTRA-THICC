Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Cameron.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Tons
No.
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
Like you care.
He was, like, a total babe
Otherwise known as an orgy?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
It's just a party. Daddy.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Thirty-two.
Get out!
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
I'm on it
Forget her sister, then.
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
You -- covered in my vomit.
I say, do what you wanna do.
I'm fine. I'm
I just need to lie down for awhile
Who?
You know what they say
What?
No, you weren't
BIANCA
So what did I have an effect on ?
So what's your excuse?
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
I hate peas.
You know what I mean
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Bianca did what?
Hi.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
Just for now.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Dr. Ruth?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Your life, and that of others!
If they agree to follow me, yes.
May I ask by whom?
Yes... I remember...
Not bad.
I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
I'm not bargaining!
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Thousands.
... and also to bring medicine.
Damn God!
I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
A woman?
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
Right.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Yeah.
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
Did you tell him you did?
Describe him.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Watch the news?
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You got any better ideas?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
I'll call it... tails.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
You know what I'm saying here.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Alright.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
He doesn't speak English.
In here, says he wants a million.
I want to document my trip to America.
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
Why not?
Shut up.  Look!
You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
Surprise!  Surprise!
Did you hurt her?
Ha. Ha.
As a plumber?!
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
What are you doing here?
You want the tape?  There it is!
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
I'm here for movies.
I used an accelerant.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
Yes?
Yes.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
Roger.
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Are you quite sure?
I see.
Fortunately, they did.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
That's true.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Sure, anything you want.
I got a lot to protect.
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
Shit.  I'm already sorry.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
They saved your ass, convict.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
I lost them, that's what happened.
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
That's the way I see it, too.
Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
Just a second, that's all!
How do you know?
So what?
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
When?
Give it back.
Try and take it.
Napoleon... small.
I brought the girl remember?
So you do know her.
Leeloo's in trouble?
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
Yeah, very big, a giant.
He's on vacation.
Where have I heard this song before?
Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
Oh god!
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
I told you not to read all that crap!
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Wonderful!
What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
Options.
Do you know how much I missed you?
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
Honey, I'm not, please...
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
You don't understand...
Amy...
Snuff?
Bullshit.
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
Is it?
If it's not him, there's no deal.
I'd rather you didn't.
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Right here.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Why don't they come to me?
I know what you did.
What?
Who is this.
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Because we're going there.
Nobody saw you bring her in?
I'm listening.
Of what sort?
Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
I'm asking.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
How much do you make now?
A daughter.
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
Who is he, his name?
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
Cash, stock certificates, and this...
You don't have any other choice.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
It won't work like that.
I hope it's nothing serious.
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
No.
That's exactly what I am.
Yes.
I didn't mean to...
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
Those are her belongings.
None too discreet, is he?
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Kristen...
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
You're not taking my baby!
My name is...
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
Sorry, babe.
There you go.  Love you.
Sobering...
Very funny.
No, the Dan part was nice...
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
My baby!
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
All of us.  Right?
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
How is he - ?
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
A lot of people think like that.
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Seems to be all around...
Right at our one-eyed friend!
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
What????
Wonderful!
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
I met Dr. Kent, once.
It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
What?
Why?
No. Black.
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
Yeah. I know about that.
Tell me.
This spring.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Damn straight!
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
Yeah?
Hmm.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
Sun's gettin high.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Shit.
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
Do what?
Break stuff?
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
No.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
I called Mommy.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
You're a policeman.
Huh?
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
Don't go playing policeman.
Fuck you.
Where's Jill?
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Did you get his number?
I know who it is.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
How's she doing?
See you tomorrow, maybe.
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Yeah. I mean that.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
What way?
I don't know for Christ's sake!
Wade.
Can --?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Is there something wrong with the phone?
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
You and me.
Wade?
There was something. It happened up your way.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
You think Jack shot him?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Then who shot him?
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Yeah, no duh.
Alice...
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
How `bout a hug for the old man.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Lemme take a look.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
Because it is my duty.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Any of us?
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
What do you want with us?
Come on, Alice.
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
Jim...
You'll do it?
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
What?
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
who can I say is calling?
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
Thank you for calling the white House...
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
Did we tape the Duke game?
I just wish it was that simple.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
Ask Simon.
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
If that's the way you want it.
Let me by, Elaine.
Ted!
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Ted, please be careful.
That was very well put, Ted.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
I guess this is a first for you.
No, I've been excited before.
Roger.
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Can't we change course?
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
You can do it from up here, Captain.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
That's okay, ROK.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Yeah.
What...?
What?
No.  Poached.  Over.
Poached!  Not over!  Over!
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
All right, it's a matter of death.
Then Elaine was right.
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
No.  I mean your relationship.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
I can't tell.
Well...not for another two hours.
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
Ted!
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
But if you'll just give me...
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Yes, Captain?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
I'm Randy.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
Show me.
Lay off, asshole.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
I am George.
Yes.
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
Did you learn anything?
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
... It's Harcourt.
We can't let him get away.
Only holds five.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
It is. 
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
How long until it blows?
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
So?  So?
Sir?
Alive?
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
Fuck you.
No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.
Did you ever have a baby?
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
Why?
No, she's fine.
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
Hardly.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Where?
Yes!
What are you talking about?
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
No, I'm not playing this game.
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Wolfi.
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
I heard voices.
Why?
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
What do you mean?
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Be careful!
Gertrude!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
May I try it?
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
I think so, Sire, yes.
Yes, indeed.
What is it?
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
I have no idea.
Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
Am I not welcome?
Pupils?
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Good morning, sir.
Why? What has happened?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
What is this?
So let me see it. Where is it?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
I never knew that music like that was possible.
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
No! No, it's him!
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
Of course.
So now - A minor. Suddenly.
Common time.
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Yes!
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
Here in Vienna.
You cannot say that!
What difference does that make?
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
I agree, Baron.
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
Who is she?
Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
Dr. Hirsch?
Yes, Doctor?
It's a full moon. Where is he?
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Has his friend appeared to him again?
Yes.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Right.
Do you like it?
I dream of death mostly.
Now what do you want to talk about?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
Bathroom.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Okay.
A doper werewolf.
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
No what?
I think he's a Jew.
No, but we're about to.
What time is it?
Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
You're talking about the woman I love.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Shall we?
Right.
Beware the moon?
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
A coyote.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Thanks a lot.
Life mocks me even in death.
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
I'm not listening!
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
If I was still alive, I probably would.
Thank you.
Hello.
Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
No.
No.
I don't rightly know, sir.
That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
I want to know why .
Matt?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Yeah?
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
Just pure luck!
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
That's very simple. I was home.
You understand?
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
A misunderstood bachelor.
Thank you!
Yes.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
Why - well, I
Yes, sir.
Good morning.
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
What'll we do?
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
Hardly.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Well, he was making love to her.
Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that
Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
Yes, why?
Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
Huh?
I don't know.
Now you tell us.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
I swear --
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
He just lost his temper a little.
We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
She was European!
But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
So what do we do, General Lee?
Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
Twenty?!
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Of course!  Uh, sir?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
On account of we're robbing it.
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
I figure.
Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
Damn. All that reading paid off.
Ma.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
And we're good at it.
You've killed your fair share of men.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Yeah.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Mmmm.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Not if I find the right girl.
And what's this right girl like?
Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
Don't swear.
Damn.
You cocky little bastard.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
This time we'll make an exception.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Just perfect.
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
You like it there, don't you?
Pick me up?
Is that Donald Trump's car?
You and...Luis?
It's not.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
What exactly do you mean?
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Lucky, I guess.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
It looks so soft.
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
Like what?
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Just say no?
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
What's that?
Patrick? Is that you?
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Well...
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
She's from...France.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Why would I?
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Does he do this all the time?
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Understandable.  Lime?
You seem...nervous.
No, I guess it's okay.
Where did Paul hang out?
No, he just hung out there.
Oh.
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
No.
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
Al.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Is that a raincoat?
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
Isn't that -- extreme?
Guilt?
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
Great.
I am. I am, sir.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
What?!
Is it your dish?
Would you like a Coke or something?
Well -- you sent for me.
What're you implying.
Did you?
'Have a look?
What?
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
Those really weird, short lines.
Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa.  I swear to God, it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it.  Let's run a printout on card entries.
You know my name.
You're famous around here.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Why's that?
He's out of prison?
No, no. Never.
Certainly not at my happy home.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
I didn't plan this.
There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.
You don't look anything like a three- year-old.
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
Good luck, Austin.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Be careful.
Right away, Exposition.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Carnies.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
My wedding tackle.
What?
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
Let me see.
How do you know?
I couldn't have another bite.
No, this is me in a nutshell.
I am not.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
I love you, Austin.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Danger's my middle name.
That's not mine.
Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
Not me.
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
You didn't...
What about his teeth?
I love you, Vanessa.
Really?
Seriously?
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
... bottle ...
... death ...
There, look!
Impossible?
Next assignment?
I'm already married ...
The result would be ...
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
Choices?
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
And I suppose you're the knight.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
No thanks.
Any other vices?
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
I might say the same.
How on earth can you tell?
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
Half-brother to be precise.
Makes two of us.
I fail to see --
Dead, I'm afraid.
How did you guess?
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.
She may try to kill you.
In your operation.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
Stay by the window. By the window.
I do.
Really -- you went with him for two years.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
Sure have...
Thank you, sir.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
Oh... I got something for that.
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
You're really pissing me off.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Let's get naked.
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Quiet, Mother.
Any time, Al.
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
Let's have a toast.
Milt?
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
I'd love that.
No sob story is going to change my mind.
This isn't right.
My gift to you.
The best table in the house.
Still drawing a blank.
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
It's comin' along... want a beer?
Thanks for the speakers.
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
You're selling dad's boat?
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
Thanks for calling.
What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
How's it going?
I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
Then why did you quit?
Leave Stephen out of this --
-- I work for the city.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
Pest control.
-- Another backdraft.
Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
What reason?
Then who wrote the report?
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Engine 115, right?
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
He's got piano lessons.
The great communicator.
Okay.
What's wrong?
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
And old ladies?
It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money!
You mean you could use it.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
All right, cop. I want my money.
There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
Are you sure?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists.  We drop science.
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
So that's what you been doing?
Manray needs a job.
Did we get our bill yet?
How you sound?
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
I'm sorry I'm late.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category.
So what's up with you?
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
Sounds risky to me.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
Break a leg.
What do you want me to say?
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
Give me the gun.
The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
I can't go all the way down south.
Peerless, last time, go see your father.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
What's a Negro.
You sing and dance?
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
...the big apple, New York, New York.
You tellin' the truth.
That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Don't try to change to the subject.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
I don't know.
We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Not one.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
Agreed.
Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
By name only.
Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.
Hmm-mmmm.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Yes, he's fine.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
Who?
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
HEY!
We found him like this...
I asked for a policeman.
I just don't like it.
That son of a bitch.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
We've found all of them.
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
There were six of us...
The creek bed --
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Yeah.
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
West... he's dead.
We just want to check your pack --
Full clip to the body --
Where are they!
Who killed Pike?
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Does Osborne agree?
I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
The Senator...
You knew Sergeant West?
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
He's in interrogation?
Yes.
Why?
You're right. We should sit in silence.
That bugs you too?
What?
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
You wanted to get the truth.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
You mean the falsely accused?
Get in.
No death certificates. No crime.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Want company?
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
I don't think I want to hear this --
The faggot speaks.
Oh, you remember now --
He wanted more than that.
He whispered it in my ear.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Fifty minutes.
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
We're not going anywhere.
Yeah.
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
There's only one I want.
Good luck, kid.
Yes.
Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
I don't expect to.
Fine, you do it.
A pleasure.
No.
Eighteen.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die." Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead.
No, I understand.
Stop.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
You learned from the best.
Okay.
You know where the chemicals are?
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
Yes.
Dad!
How what happens?
The River!
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
Because he's dying.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
Probably tonight.
Did you?
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
How much time does he have left?
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
Do you know who that is?
What for?
No I don't.
The sets were good.
Yes.
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
Oh.  We are Russian.
And...
Right.
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
No. It is too judgmental.
He wants money.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
Yes.
I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."
Syevodnya
It's makes it easier. Okay.
In the world.
Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
What?
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I don't have any money.
Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
Excuse me?
I don't hate you.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
You didn't mind too much.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
She's dead.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
I don't want anyone to die.
It's alright.
Okay. Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Yeah, I know.
Then start taking them seriously.
You didn't have to do this.
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Yeah.
She's around. Always is.
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
Now wait...
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
I begged him not to go. And he did.
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Whose doin' is that?
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!
I can handle that.
I ain't in a hurry.
I'm here with you.
The... chain helps.
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
Yes'sir.
So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
You feelin' sick?
Yeah?
Yeah, I do.
The hell are you talkin' about?
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
First decent idea you've had.
Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language.
All right, how's the new partner?
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
I'll get him for you, Nick.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
A resort city, Beppu.
So I bring some cheese?
It's done.  You don't have to come.
We need the plate to negotiate with.
I don't think so.
He's got a reason.
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
He killed a police officer.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
If he won't cooperate?
Then go get him.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Dr. Tyrell?
Where do we start?
I was just about to have my dinner.
Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.
Okay, but...
It's okay.  Forget it.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
I'm taking a piss.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
You mean the snake.
Sorry.
I bet I would.
Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
Of course not.
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
I'd never get an abortion.
Oh.
Don't be fooled by appearances.
I never felt better.
Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
What difference will it make?
The machine works.  She is.
What desert?
I don't have one.
Beautiful.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
Come where?
My office.
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
Eve? I'm leaving.
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
What is it?!
Oh, I could die...
Take it. damn it!
My Mom and Dad.
Very funny, smart ass.
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
Night!
Okay.
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
It didn't used to be that way.
Two weeks.
You said it would be easy!
In the house?
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Well...yeah. Okay.
Good-bye!
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
I know...and I'm really sorry.
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
What?
Yes, sir.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.
Because he must!
Your mom made that all by herself.
Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh...  They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Sorry, that's the largest city.
Okay.
So, did you buy a movie?
The hotel.
My father is a genius.
How old do I look?
Goodnight.
Really? No kidding?
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
Well, where are you --
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
No.  They all do.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
Really?
How could you?! This is just like home!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
You have tranquilizers?
What?
What shall we call him?
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
You bet.
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Sure.
We do?
Well, I am the head of this household--
I want him to at least see the sky!
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
I knew you'd like him.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
What?!
Um...uh...
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
Yes.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Okay.
Yes.
Why do you do it?
Yeah. I get it.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Is Sandy part of this?
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
Lie down on the bed.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
No. I should go.
Yes. Frank--
I sure don't hate you.
Whatiya mean?
I want you to hurt me.
Yes.
Frank would open you.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Kiss me.
I asked first.
You what?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Yes, but.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Speak to me Fucker.
No thanks. What does that mean?
Here's to Ben.
What?
Nothing.
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
Yeah.
Well.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
I don't know.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Are you sure?
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
You saw a lot in one night.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay, okay.
You like mysteries that much?
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.
You didn't tell him about me?
No.
NO.
Frank!!!
Probably not. No. Why?
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Okay.
Stop it Mike.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
This kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. If he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. But it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it. I mean I had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
What?
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled.
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
We're here brother.
You gotta keep going.
Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
Well, I didn't but...
If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes.
...so that which is good may flourish
I don't know they just always need it.
A bit.
It is your corrupt we claim.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
Uh... two shooters!
Fan-fuckin-tastic!
Of course they were. How many?
Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Twist of lemon!
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
We promise.
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
What are you serious?
No. You sure you're okay?
So?
So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?
What is it my son?
Yes.
Yes.
You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
Have you no fear of God?
How long since your last confession, my son?
The... The funny man.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Would they do that?
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
Like he meant it.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
What do you think?
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
On your marks...  Get set go.
Bob?
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Inez, this is --
What. What's the matter?
Obviously. That's a given.
Bob?
Where was it parked?
You were asleep.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
OK.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
That's not correct.
Sure.
He seems pretty good.
OK. Mark that down.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Stand by, Bird Dog.
Where's Kumar?
Yeah.
Oh, I'd say about --
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
What do you mean?
Yes, he did.
Exactly. Woah.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
You think I'm improving?
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Who's got the car keys?
Yeah.
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
I'll just drive my car.
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
That could be anybody's.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Where's Applejack?
What's that?
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
I'm trying.
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
Oh, yeah.
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
What can we do?
Where's that guy going?
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
No, it's not.
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
Never heard of it.
I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
Excuse me.
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.
I'm sorry, Ward.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
Had to be done.
No. You lost your way.
Show me again...
Then what?
Conklin up front.
The Telegraph office.
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
-- hang on --
What if it's not who you think it is?
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
I did.
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
Abbott?
What do you mean?
Careful...
What's that?
And the Germans can't match it?
Who's going? Us?
-- the hotel -- how far? --
Hold on...  Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
It's a lot of money, Pam.
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
Believed what?
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
What the hell is a "Treadstone?"
And what about you, anything?
Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
Wallace's followers.
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
I rest.
That's just a dream, William!
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
No. He did not.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
Tonight then.
...I wouldn't know.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
I am trying.
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
And the bad news?
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
How long will I be in here?
Where are you now?
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
But I... I need those books.
Photos?
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
You'll see.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Like how?
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Different? How?
That I didn't leave you there to rot.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Stop! Take me back!
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
Wow... read something.
Gee, thanks friend.
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
Meant no offense.
I thought I was the bad guy!
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Oh, yes, please.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
I don't buy or sell human beings.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
What are they?
Here's looking at you, kid.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
I didn't count the days.
Has it got a wow finish?
You can believe that if you want to.
Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
No.
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Be careful.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
Won't you join us for a drink?
Not at all.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
Thank you.
What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
Yes, I get the point.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
May we proceed with the business?
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.  Captain, would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Thank you.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
A leader, like Laszlo?
But everybody's having such a good time.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Yeah? What's his name?
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
I'm a drunkard.
Hello Ugarte.
-- You thought what?
For how long?
Uh, my watch stopped.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
Nobody remembers that.
Do too little you'll die.
You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Well, not really, I --
Let me guess, Russia came up?
I can't even keep fish alive.
And for you --
There isn't any us.
I burned the Christmas tree.
A few things came up.  Or went down.
Is that Jango?
That about sums it up.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
Great.  Really.
I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.
I'm so glad you're alive.
Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
Mom, meet Jango.
Don't you even think about it.
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
You fucked us over.
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
To Wilson.
Hallelujah.
Believe me I know.
Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
San Francisco.  And you?
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
I know.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Candy. Candy Kendall.
Oh...
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
It will be okay.
Nothing.
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.
Why?
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
They wanted a girl.
Only the right people can have you, Curly.
I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Really! Is it serious?
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
I don't know it.
Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
I don't need your gratitude.
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
What you got a picture of your heart for?
So what?
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
She took off on the bicycle, man.
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
The Anti-Christ?
Gee... What makes you say that?
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
Isn't it always?
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
Yes it is, Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her!
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
We'll take care of it.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
So what? We just stay clear of him.
Jake, I mean, come on --
Tonight. Just me.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
Because you killed one of my crew.
You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Great. Thank you.
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Lighten up.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
WHAT?
I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?
Lily... Jesus Christ...
No, I want my cut!
Then shut up.
Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young.
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
Eee Oott Auught!
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
A Fed? Is he close?
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
What do you want?
Roger that.
To who?
My car's in the garage.
Goodnight.
I don't know anything about it.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Habib?
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Not entirely.
You mean I won't resist them.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Probably.
Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
It will.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
You're entitled to your opinion.
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
You're already alone.
Well, thank you anyway.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
There's a casino in this hotel.
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
I'll watch.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
What kind of trouble?
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
What about my neck?
I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
I have to take the car.
Thank you.
I've still got mine.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Ross.
Over the river.
Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
You're talking about complicity.
I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
"The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway.
Don't worry.
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
What happens if I want to sneeze?
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
Good call.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
No.
Fine.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
Bruised.
Where is the key?
Pinback, throw me the chart log.
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
Right!
This is fun.
And you can only do it once, right?
That is correct.
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
Mafhkin oble groop...
In a second.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
What?
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
No kidding?
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
It didn't work?
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
This won't hurt.  Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D.  Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Leave.  Now.
No.
No way.
Am I?
SHHH!  Don't do that!
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
Mommy, where are you?
Whoever that is.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
So what are you gonna do about it?
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
Look, I don't know what you want--
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
Oh?
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Right here someplace.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
Straight.
What?
No.
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
But I'll take a rain check...
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
What happens if you level with her?
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
She was the one--
I was on call. 
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
You got in the car, didn't you?
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
We won?!
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Hello summer detention.
What do you want?
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Not if I shoot first!
Yeah.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
Like a spear.
Beg pardon?
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Not until like... eighth grade.
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
You'll know soon enough.
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
Sure.
Why is that?
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
And what?
Well...
What?
The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
That is a terrible nickname.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
I met a girl.
Yes.
What else do you think about during school?
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
What else makes you feel regret?
That I did it again.
You've done it again?
Then how is time travel possible?
Because you tell Mom everything.
Congratulations.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Frank?
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Kitty...
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
But now you can't go.
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Yeah, you betcha...
Really, Loretta?
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
That's it, I'm goin'...
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
It's okay.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
You heard me. Where is it?
Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
And the bite marks on my ears?
Yes, Leslie!
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
That's right.
The bitch.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
Enid ate a whole pan!
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
"My"...
Is that all?
Never mind then, I'll get in touch with him myself -
Half watch dog?
Did you shoot the rapids?
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
Then you don't wanna work hard?
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
That's not bad for any day.
He's working very hard - I got him a job driving Firefly's car - He's-a driving him crazy and I'm driving him nuts - P-E-A-N-U-T-S
I can't do it right away.
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.
What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth...  ...but we can have a little family of our own.
I still like UPSTART the best.
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
Take a seat -- you're next. 
The king can do no wrong!
Oh, would you...?
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
I thought everything was working out fine.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
Do you?
Oh Frederick.
Like this. 
What do you mean?
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
You've acquired a taste for this?
Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
Three quarters of an hour.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
Oh no?
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
Righteousness for his namesake.
Yes.
Of course! What did you think?
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
You did this for me?
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
I've heard.
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
Well...
Welcome home, John.
WELCOME?
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
What?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
Goodbye, Aud...
Of course.
Not quite...
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
I shouldn't have come.
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
It is day, of course, Freya.
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Well... isn't it great?
Well, how d'you think I feel?
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
What -- rape?
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
But...
Look out!
Like fish.
Just say something cheerful.
Keitel Blacksmith?
We'd be the first!
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
Let me do something for myself for a change!
Your lord.
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.
Got you!
What have you got there?
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
YOU do it!
Help!
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
Stop it!
Dad!
And something to sharpen them with?
Yes, Mum.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
I told you that later.
In the world.
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
It's okay, really.
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Yeah, I got it.
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
What?
Very much.
It's pretty.
Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Oh, yeah.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
You'll call me, right?
Okay.
Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
Yeah, Tangerine?
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
I know.
I think she's great.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
I think we should go.
Joel, come here. Please.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Oddly enough, I do.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
And what are you like? A wino?
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
Oh! Great. That's great!
I had a good time last night. I really did.
Go.
I don't know. He's not on the map.
Once, maybe.
How did I look?
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
Thanks.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
Alexander Pope?
It's no big deal.
You are such a sweetheart.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
Yeah.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
Save your breath for the climb.
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled "Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "Indians" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906.
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Like what?
You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
A born freak can only go uphill.
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
The containment, Second Containment...
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
Roger that.
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
We'll make it.
Hear what?
One thing at a time, let's keep him breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding out...
The dark inside me.
From the Other Place...
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Justin.
Justin. I won't let you die.
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
What you got, Peters?
Peters...
Where has it been for the last seven years?
That's what we're here to find out.
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
It's complicated...
The date.
What about it?
It's done.
You... You can't do that!
Better if I just show you.
Get out of there now!
Radiation interference?
Carbon dioxide?
We can take the filters from the Clark...
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
What's causing the readings?
So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
I've got a theory.
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
He served on the Goliath.
They're explosive charges.
I did.
I'm trying, goddammit --
Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Victor did.
What did he do to the uniform?!
It's easy for you to be patient.
I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Baby, you're scaring me.
I already got it. Everything I want.
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
This makes five.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
That's terrible news...
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
They're not costumes.
Right, whatever, have fun.
But all these people...
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Yes, thanks.
Passion.
What in the world would give me that idea?
Are you kidding?
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
Hilarious.
Ben did this.
Ben did this?
Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
You can't leave them out there.
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
Oh, I think you already have.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
I don't know. I was just curious.
Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
Yes, sir.
What a guy.
Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
He's my friend, too.
No. Are you crazy?
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
No. It's too soon.
Really?
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Fine. Get lost.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
He is.
All right.
They're fuckin' with us.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
What should I do?
Should we buy a frame for that?
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
Thanks a lot.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
I paid for it and everything.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
No. I mean back to your home.
Do you really have to go?
Oh. I see.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Two Cokes.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Not for me.
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Tell me. What do you want?
Crying? Why was she crying?
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Naw! Not a major.
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
I have to go.
It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
Whatever's right.
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
The cops?
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
Lucy is looking for you.
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people.
We can't risk letting them in.
Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
We're going to get my little girl.
Nah, I got the gun.
Upstairs.
You gotta be with me on this.
And the rest of 'em?
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Shit!
The door... on three.
Why don't you go check it out?
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Who's with me?
He's dead.
Why not then?
Okay then.
Open?
Seven.
Seven.
I'm fine! I'm fine!
Amazing you made it this far.
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
Putting on my armor.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
Oh. I mean, good.
Thank you --
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
I'm not!
Where's Clifford?
Who?
I know, but --
He knows, Frances.
There've been some calls.
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
Fired?
Showdown.
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
Were you a drug addict?
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain -- 
...Then go.
I love you too, Francie.
Please, Francie...
When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
Address?
I wouldn't miss it.
Why... yes.
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.
Not me. But other people seem to.
You're not the quiet type, Frances.
Kaminski.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
No, they don't, do they?
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Frances...
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
No, Harry, I can't -- 
Who said I was a lady?
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
I should've known...
What's that?
To quarter-horses.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
I hope so, Frances.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.  ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
What'd you do?
Fine!
What?
'Golden Boy.'
But I want to. I'm trying!
You think I got it?
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
You kill me, Mama.
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
I'm going out!
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
What?
Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
Huh?
You drove him to his torment.
Worse.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Why do you not go to them?
Your crime... as well as mine.
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
I'll be waiting. And watching.
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
And you look so lovely.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
All my life I've known.
I wish to be your wife.
Your decision. For us.
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
No. But someday.
Very well then.
Quite a few.
How much longer?
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
No. They don't.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
You know of it?
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
I will protect you.
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
Un-hunh.
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
Maybe I can help?
Hey, guys!
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
Somebody'll see.
Don't get up. Take a second...
Get behind him more.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
I love you.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Rocky Road.
Just my son and I.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
You said it was just you and your son.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
Yeah, follow us.
Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
The truth hurts.
I'm exhausted.
He's my son.
Sorry, I need everybody.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Yes, they do.
You're a preacher?
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
I can handle Richie, don't worry.
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
I don't have the slightest idea.
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
Do what?
What did I say?
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
What dya mean?
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
Do they have a waterbed?
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
What?
Keep your voice down.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
That's what you look like.
What do you mean?
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
I've been accused of that wish.
Don't say my name.
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
Pardon?
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
I'm not sure what --
Sir?  What did he say?
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
I'll work on it, ma'am.
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
I oughtta report you.
I'll try anyway, sir.
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
I don't know, I don't care.
What?
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
You got anybody, Wick?
I think you look beautiful.
Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides...
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
I don't know...
Mighta been civilian.
You heard me.  Move on.
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
So am I.
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Only one way to find out.
It's good to see you, Nick.
How do you know?
Our network covers the Ranger games.
You'd be surprised.
Nick Tatopoulos.
I left my forgery kit back at the office.
We? I don't think so.
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Oh, I'm not married.
I don't think so.
Allez, allez!
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
You're standing on it.
That's right.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
You were right.
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Open.
You go first! There's no time!
Nothing.
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
You have a better plan, Alex?
You could order something in.
Yes but, we were wondering-
What's  your name, son?
It's okay. Listen-
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
All systems are working, Commander.
... What does that mean?
OK!
I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
You... know us?
It's ... incredible.
Something BAD happened here.
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.
We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
Jason..
Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
Gwen...
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?
Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
We pretend...
I... certainly, but-
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
... Maintenance facility...
You what?.. What are you talking about?
Push It. Hold it down.
Tommy, we have these...
Get oacK on their tail.
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
Well, truth be told?  I was a pharmacist.  Alexander?
I?  You all know my history.
Same old story.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
Marquis!  Get these men reformed, send Steuben and Wayne out on the left...
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there!  Tell them I will give them my decision then.
Who's in command out there?
You invented this, this...
If he isn't, then he's stupid.
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
I understand, George.
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
These supplies...?
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear:  a classless world.  Not a very real expectation.
Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say?  If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory.
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
What else?  From Virginia?
We're leaving them?
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
It's stupid, of course.
Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
No. What's this?
I have to ask you for that key.
Your who?
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
What about her?
Tell you what...
Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping.
In the can. That the money?
What?
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
Yeah? Which terminal?
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
That's right.
I'm a producer.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.
The shylock's the good guy.
"Mr. Lovejoy".
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
What do you get out of this?
Let's see how we get along.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
What happened? The pressure got to you?
I'm looking at you.
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
Here's another tip...
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Rough day on the set?
Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...'
Depends, who pays?
You don't like Martin much, do you?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
You're as bad as Harry...
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
You seem to feel fine about it.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
Morning, skipper.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Wrong. It's Friday.
Maureen.
Yeah.
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
Get up.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
How much longer's that gonna take?
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
Could be meant as a warning.
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
You smashed it!
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Probably didn't have time.
No.
Sudden flashes of light.
Better than starving to death.
The guy. He just came this way.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
Yup.
Epps.
I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
If it was a ship she hit.
Showing you what?
What happened.
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
You got that right.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
We could call for help.
Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
Lost my sea legs.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
Guess.
YES.
Yup.
Nothing.
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Hello...
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
Uh-oh.
I...
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
I didn't check my messages...
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
No.
Why?
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
Yeah, well --
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
What?
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
Why do I always have to do it?
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.
Gross!
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
"Hassle"?
You won't believe it! Guess!
No way... when?
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
You're gross.  See that guy?
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
Don't you want nice stuff?
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
Nothing.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
It's kind of falling apart.
I did too!
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
Sure, I guess.
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
Every guy has a type!
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
Let's just say "music" - that way you only use up one...  Wait, we have to go in here for a second...
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
Yeah, but still...
What? Why?
It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Who knows?
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
I... I don't think so.
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
What's up?
Jesus, how can you stand her?
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
What about Joe?
Yeah, well I like you too...
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
I-I-I...
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
She's not at home?
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
There is no reason for fear.
As are they all.
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
But overall, you're pleased?
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
You never had it.
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse.  And I'm one of his defenders.  Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking. 
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
Somehow I guessed. 
Has it ever done that before?
Have you ever failed?
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
The workers don't get on?
Do you love her?
I have to ask- why do you need me?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Since his beard was red.
I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
I don't believe you had a mother. 
They will want a lot of money.
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
No.  Not that I can recall.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
Okay, let's take a look.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Let me jingle you right now.
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
What are you doing up here?
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
You're right.  We should stay.
Too bad for the Moldavians.
My pleasure.
Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
Do I?
Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
Something good --
There's something very familiar about this painting.
Who?
Oh, Ray --
Who, Ray?
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
Wonder what?
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
No?  What do I act like?
Thanks.  What's in there?
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
Goodbye.
No kiss?
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
You must have gotten the last copy.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
Whoa!! Nice voice.
One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
I think it's the food of the future.
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
I don't believe in luck.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Thank you.
Has this ever happened before?
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Great!  How's it going?
Are you Peter Venkman?
Because you didn't say the magic word.
Why do you want to see it?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
Gozer.
What do you mean by "seen?"
Fourteen hundred.
No sense worrying about it now.
All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
How do you know?
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
What?  What popped in there?
Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
Mmmhmmm.
Judgement Day ...
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
Send them out!
Gladly Caesar.
We have to stop the Germans now!
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
Would that Marcus had lived.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
On my honor as your daddy...
Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
I want nothing to do with the arena.
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
Yes, I do.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
Yes.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
What?
Oh.
All right then! Yes!
Well, I want you to leave.
How could you do that, Benjamin?
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
If you want.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
You really will?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Why wouldn't it?
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Why do you have to see him?
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Plastics.
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
Not exactly.
Oh -- no sir.
Where are you?
What?
It's in the main ballroom.
A single room or a double room?
Where is it?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Of course.
But it's light in there now.
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
Did you know that?
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Come on.
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Waiter!
I haven't. No.
What?
Either one will be fine.
This is all terribly wrong.
Wait a minute!
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Oh.
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
Not exactly.
Was he a law student at the time?
Art.
No.
There's nothing to tell.
Good.
Don't start acting hurt.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
You don't have to say that.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
I don't believe you.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
No -- they don't.
I don't know. I want it to be --
You got me.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
I know.
How long have we known each other now?
I will.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
Mrs. Robinson?
Benjamin Braddock.
Can you look through the glass.
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
I'll give you ten seconds.  He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --
Not now.
Well?
Yes.
Have you got that skeleton key?
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
I'll pay you back.
Who?
Have you seen it?
Oh!
Dictation.  You know...
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Where downstairs?
Will you do me a big favor?
Yes -- I'd love to.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Because you love me -- you love me?
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
So alone.
Strange man...
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
I want to be alone --
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
Really?
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
Very early in the morning.
For Vienna?
No?
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane.
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Yes -- but the audience.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat! Aristocrat! 
Good heavens. What for?
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot and cold running water -- You see, I can get a bath whenever I like.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
I never danced before -- in public.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Later?
Oh yes, of course.
You're a very unusual stenographer --
Me.
What brown hands you have.
Skiing? 
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
Can't you understand me?
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
I understand perfectly.
A thousand marks -- 
Well, he's a gentleman!
You're sweet.
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
Why not?
Exactly.
Yes --
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
Good morning, Madam.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Oh -- but it can't be.
There was -- there was.
Certainly, sir.
Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
No news yet?
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
Pretty as a picture.
I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
You expect me to buy this?
No.
You'll never shit right again.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
So here we are!
Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken.
What? He's going to be all right!
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Why? What's wrong?
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.
Well, uh... No.
Perk.
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me.  It didn't.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
No.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
NO!
Taking you for granite?
You called the doctor, huh?
You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
I'll sign that affidavit.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Nobody does that single-o.
I've heard the name.
Is that right?
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
Upstate.
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I saw her.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
But the setup's there. It's there now.
I don't think I need it.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
You up to it now?
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
Well, when you put it that way.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
No.  Wait for the police.
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
Forget it.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
Nothing.
Yes.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
John, you can't help her now.
Yeah.
Okay... thank you.
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
I can't believe this is happening.
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing.
Why?  You interested?
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Is Tim there?
Guess so ...
The voice man!  He's here!
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
It's a sign.  He's come home.
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
No.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
Go home!
Let's talk about it some other time.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
Me?
You.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
Is Penelope in?
Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
Are you--
Are you--do you--
Is anybody besides you here now?
Where's Mom?
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
Man and boy.
She met him at college.
College?
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
Uck.
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
That's a rifle you have?
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
I'm engaged.
Like hugging a lamp post.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
We thought it was an emergency.
I was, I was.  It never lasts long.
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
Like what?
You're begging him to kill you?
Don't!
Ah!  The lady is armed.
Load it for her.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
You've killed women?
It's always locked.
Will you please go?  An emergency!
I came back.
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
Good night.
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
Correct.
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
And terror, if you don't mind.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
Poison.
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
New lives begin!
What are you going to do?
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
You didn't even find that out?
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
I don't care what she wears.
He's a ghost!
Who have you been talking to?
Yeah.
Doing what?
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?
Is he coming home?
You figure!
You're saying no.
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
It is?
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
We met here earlier this evening.
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
Yes, we do.
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
That you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room.
Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
But is she, has...
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
Okay.
I don't know no Tod.
Man, how many girls do you need?
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
Are you sure it's all right?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
The other girl is the star?
Where's he?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
When do we start?
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
No.
Neither am I.
Shit.
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
But what?
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
Where is he, Niki?
Where is she?
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
What do you mean?
Do you think she's safe?
Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
I just heard. Who is he?
It's just a name.
What?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
I don't know.
Where!
No.
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Good.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
What exactly do you have in mind?
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
What's that?
I'll tell you, that was an interesting case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled runaway cases like it before. Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. In fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing.  I guess I gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal.
To his own daughter?
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
Yes, I am.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Wait here.
Because if you are...
How interesting.
I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Do you sing and dance?
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
No.
Eh, fine.
Me! No. Of course not.
Because they are all the same.
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
No more revolts.
Well, I don't...
But I don't play anything.
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
How ingenious! Tell me about them.
I like you, Harold.  Come, I'll teach you to waltz.
It's so blue.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Do you think there is any life up there?
Why?
It's true. I can't live without you.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
A sunflower?
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I wouldn't say "benefit."
What about the draft?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
None at all?
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
Very well.  Now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. How do you feel about that?
Why?
I'd have liked to talk to him.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
What's the chance of getting one of these?
Well, it's a tricky turn.
We've always been here.
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
So you slept O.K.?
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
Then why are you here?
I've come for my father!
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
We don't take hints.
Red, I found something --
I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
I thought you liked being on TV.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
You're doing fine.
C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
-- should go back. Now!
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Hostage negotiations.
Alone?
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
No. Myers is taking me.
I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
Strong.
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Do you really need this bed, lady?
Uh-huh.
It's just a puzzle box.
Who are you?
No!
You remember.
No.
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
Well can I come in or not?
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
What kind of doors?
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
There's very little I can do about it.
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
Just a thought --
I thought half of it was your brother's?
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
Let me see.
I'm going to throw up.
Are you O.K.?
Just feeling a bit sick.
Kirsty.
Come with me then.
Not much.
Just soda.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
Where are you?
I will. See you.
You like?
Steve?
Sure.
Yes!
I have to get out.
I'm coming!  Sleep well.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
What happened to you?
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Well what's the point in that?
Not the point.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
Fuck off, Barry.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
Sonic Death Monkey.
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
I have all of the others.
NO--!
Oh well.  Nevermind.
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Right.  Why?
Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Yeah.
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
Fine.
-- FUCK OFF!
It's Vince and Justin.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
My house?
So you weren't interested in music at all?
I don't know.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Fine.  One.
It sounds stupid.
You won't like it.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
Mmm hmm.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
In a minute.  When I get it together.
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
To make you feel better.
No, but...
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
Wanna go to dinner?
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
No.  Probably not.
Hey.  It's Liz.
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
Well she --
Is Ray going?
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
You haven't even seen it!
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
So you'll stay?
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
Right.
How's the store?
Well I don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes.  You meet someone, you move in, she goes.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
Well we don't.
No, we...
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
We're not there yet, Justin.
Whatever.
Nice.
What's the name of your label?
Huh?
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
Have you gone to the police?
I'd rather hear yours.
You are being foolish.
You're wrong.
You're a fool.
You want me to front for you.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
I see.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
You killed those other two.
You kill with your left hand?
You're never "just curious".  You've met my neice, Brenna.
We've got nothing to say.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
It'll never stick.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
What's all of this got to do with me?
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
Why are you here?
Does it change with me in the room?
It is less.
No!
Me arm hurts.
All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
What would you like?
Like you.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
Not likely.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
Either you are with me or against me.
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
It is the gathering, my friend.  The settling of old scores.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
I do hope she enjoys a good show.
Are you here?
He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
But --
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
The Criminal Courts Building.
Hello, Bruce...
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
That's the kind of stuff they want!
Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
What?!!
Just what I said. That's what I --
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
What's his line?
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
Thanks.
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
She jumped out of the window.
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
I know, but --
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
Where's Butch?
I'm finished.
Was she? Did you notice?
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Is this the Community Hospital?
Come here. See if we can move it.
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
In a way.
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
What's that -- what's that?
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
What?
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 
It's a deal. Let me up.
Yes, sir.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Three bullets! Any good?
Okay.  Up you go, Mollie.
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
So long, Hildy.
I guess so.
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
Hold her, boys!
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
What is it?
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
I'll go right after it.
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
And up a dime.
No -- what?
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. The whole police force standing on it's ear.
What are your beliefs, Earl?
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
The what?
Yes, yes!
No, I don't think so.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
Very well, Grandpa.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
What's that?
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Ask her yourself.
...and four and five...
That's not the point.
It's like telling fibs.
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
I don't know?
....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
And absent bridegrooms!
What's that?
Out.
Who said anything about love?
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
How are we going to cope?
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Father, that's enough now
And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
Really, that's a long time.
Cool.
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
Oh, wonderful.  Fucking psycho.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
I don't know.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
It's a girl.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
There's a dog in the road.
There's not enough room.
What?
Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
Hmmmmm.
Goddamn.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
When you were outside with Bill.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
No please, let me sit this one out.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Yep, I found something.
Oh, right.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Great.
You said it, not me.
Huh?
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...
Well, go get her.
Fit the profile?
No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
Right.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
That must be him.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
Gabrielle.
Woof.
Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
Oui.
Oui. Perfect!
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
Fine.
What is it?
Unnhh.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
It's okay, Puff.
Very well.
Good. I'll show you how, apey.
What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Ouch. Yeah?
You still in the market for a real boy?
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Oh?
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Please, honey, let me in.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
You've got to respect that.
Where?
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
You do?
Do you?
Of course.  I simply love the... naturalness of it all.
What SPF, sweetie?
What?
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Your entire body?
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
Sure. Of course.
So he's doing okay?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Yes.
Yahoo!
Even better.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
Next game, ten bucks.
That's right, Miss Packard.
And a fact is a fact.
Well, nobody has to sell.
You tell me.
Oh, about five hundred.
Cash.
Deal.
Two.
Yeah? Why?
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
What is?
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
Where?
Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
How much?
When do I raise the bet?
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
Well, here it's half.
You don't pay me? You gonna get your thumbs broken.  And your fingers. And if I want them to, your right arm in three or four places.
Who's he?
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
Give me a drink, will ya?
You don't need a drink.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
Yeah. Just like that.
Glad to meet you.
Yeah, sure has.
Yeah. Sure.
Hi.
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
Since four.
Yours.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
Then why go to the bus station?
Around.
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
You told me.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Give it back to me.
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
No. You?
What's it so hot in here for?
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Oh, grow up.
Why?
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
I hear you've been looking for me.
Preach... get it at Johnny's.  You got a bet.
You watch me.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
No.
You lived like this once.
That is not now, human!
My name is Robert.
Do you want to go on?
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
Yes.
We don't know that --
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
Do we have to?
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
George, you're acting very strangely.
It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
Mr. Gardner, I --
Of course.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
But it's not, Jimmy.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
It's really nice of you to help us.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
More than likely.
What happened?
So think already.
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
You can do that?
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
I can't shake her free.
I had a feeling you would.
Better than we thought.
Then find them.
Really? You don't mind?
Really? Ballet?
I thought you didn't recognize me.
That'd be cool!
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me.
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
You are on your own?
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Alexandretta. Now we know.
Schneider?
Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
Pretty sure.
I said don't go between them!
Don't know. Think of something.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
I can reach it. I can reach it...
Then wait -- count to twenty.
But what are you doing here?
Through the library?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
I came here to save you.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
What???
And the chair.
What?
Head for the fireplace!
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
All right Dad -- tell me.
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
Dad, we're well out of range.
What did you find, Dad?
Come on -- come on!
No camels!
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
Something magical. A sacred rock.
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
Nee chin lie how ma?
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Yeah, that's what happened...
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
Why?
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
A SNAKE!!
What?!
Can you move your arm?
Just one arm!
It's starting to let go!
That's good -- you're doing fine.
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
A what?!
So now they believe me.
You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
What for?
Willie, come on!
I know you did!
You're not gonna believe this...
Who was it?
Me.
Who?
I see...
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Shut up!
Where are we now?
What are you doing in my head, Al?
Me? What'd I do?
You said it.
Kill myself.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Hear voices don't I.
Of course you do!
You're gonna explain.
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
Too late...They want you.
No. Don't tell the guards.
Yeah...Who is?
What do you mean we.
We have to get out of here.
Just walk down the hall?
Where are we going?
Who did?
The man.
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
You are in trouble. Now do it.
We'll change your appearance.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
Which language?
Don't just stand there, say something.
Wait.
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
That's a big if.
I don't know what's going on.
You're doing great with her.
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
You got any books in there?
Joe! It's 56 hours!
Osaka.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........
I can't keep up.
I don't trust her.
Come on.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
Oh no!
I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
It's all we've got.
Oh, I can't.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
And how do you service foreigners.
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
We're here.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
Not you. Them.
I noticed you staring.
Whatever it is, don't do it.
Sir?
Nothing.
What?
Yes?
...right here too.
Yes, of course.
Me still. They left you alone?
It's not apparent.
I am sort of scattered.
Can I help?
That you're not crazy.
And how'm I doing?
Just Okay...
And you, what do you like?
Wanted to get to know you.
No, he didn't do that.
Food doesn't agree with me.
Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
What's he done?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
What is it?
Then why are you smiling like that?
Ryuji and Gruner.
And you?
Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
Where would you go to sell a chip?
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
This going to work?
They asked about you.
Why?
You can say that again. What do we do?
For you.
Why not, what are you going to do?
Do something!
It was you.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
Why not?
The experiment. The danger...
Yes.
Yeah? What for?
Pooh's dusty, sweetheart... he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? So what's -- what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs "don't breathe any more of that dust in."  ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches. And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. And, we give you medicine, and you get better. Huh? Okay? You're better already, aren't you?
How long?
You got a deal. 
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Okay.
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
I don't know what he was thinking.
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
...fuck is this? Fuck!
Good.
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
Then what are you going to do?
I'm afraid you are.
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
What about you, you got a crew already?
I didn't want to leave it there...
I don't understand.
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
I'm alone on this...
It would be better if he called us.
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
What do you mean?
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
Oh, lots.
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
Next to your father?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it.
They hate each other --
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
Who do you want me to kill?
Uh... poetry recitation.
Sustained.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
Ruth Rabino.
You like kids.
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
But you don't agree?
And you've always loved him?
He's passionate.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
From a -- girlfriend.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
She held that against you?
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
Huh?
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
Do you want me to sleep on it?
I think a nursery should be right off the master suite. My parents put mine in the guest house. Apparently they did have a Fisher Price intercom, but my mother turned it off when I was seven months old because I was so --
I love you. I want to have your baby.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
It's okay Joe.
You were going to have this thug...?
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Murder?
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
We are. And it's winding down.
Sometimes I forget.
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
So where are you now?
Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
Hello Miles.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
She's here now.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
We've outlined a settlement...
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
In anticipation of making you sick.
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Mother?
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Three is not Farrow.
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
Yes, I knowbut
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmmmmm. This filet mignon is divine!
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Oh, no.
Why? Do you know him? 
They're practically all the same, sir. 
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn As life's corners I . . .
. . . turn."
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you  scram.
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
I don't want it reported!
Yes.
That's right. You didn't.
Beat it! 
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike. 
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Outside!
Heretake mine.
Heyyou're little, aren't you?
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Um. You're doing all right.
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
I don't trust that chatterbox.
To New York?
Of course it is.
But what!
What?
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Hitch-hiking.
Hayin my teeth.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for youcarrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught megoodnight!
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
Not interested. 
Whatever you say, darling.
When does the bus leave?
Wait a minute, GordonI
What's the thousand bucks for?
Never mind . . . Listensuppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
You're drunk.
I'd put you there myself.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
I dunno.
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is"  No, do you really?
That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
That's right.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
Huh?
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with
Sh-sh-sh! Soft pedal, you mug!before I What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thingand you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
Yeah ?How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Right.
Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
You know you keep saying that.
You're not digging.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
The anonymous kind, Chief.
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
He had his palm print on the weapon.
Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
There's a word - orders.
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
This is Louisiana, chief.  How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one.  Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one of his best men.
I did.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
Why Galveston?
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
Nonsense.  What next?
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
Tough day.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
"Once ONI, always ONI"?
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
How many men?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
You're so naive, mister.
I just don't want to do it.  What else?
It's a means to an end.  This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow.
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.
You.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
What'd ya mean?
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
She almost sounds scared.
What's she willing to give us?
Okay.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
He's got that kinda money?
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Cash poor?
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
Are you?
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
You're not old. You look great.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
You don't actually do it that way?
I called you last night.
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
When did you decide?
Did you do it that night?
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
In a dress.
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
I know.
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Not every day?
If I'm working, I can help you.
A Broadway shopping bag.
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
Not yet.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
What did you do after that?
Not in the fitting room.
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
Do you think I took some of that money?
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Sure.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
Go sit over in that chair.
One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
They already know it's you.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
Where you gonna be during all this?
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
It's a diet thing?
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
Detroit.
C'mon, don't lie.
Uh-huh?
We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
Whatcha watchin'?
I follow.
But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
What does that mean?
You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
Not now, pick me up.
You know how she is.
Where did you shoot her?
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
What?
Tell me.
He's a big one. You two tight?
You have cash. What do you need me for?
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
You think you could do that?
On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.
I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies.  I get my money back, don't I?
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Was she?
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
How the fuck did he find me?
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
And you did that to protect my interest?
She's been there since Thursday night.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
Uh-huh.
You sure?
Give me his home number.
How do you know?
Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd want to hurt him?
Short? It's ended.
Tell your mother.
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
Shit!
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
How do you know?
I saw Sarah the other day.
A bit.
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Jacob Singer.
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
Your back? Did you fall?
Where is the lamp?
Where to?
What do you mean?
No. Have you seen my glasses?
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
I don't let anybody call me that.
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
Lemme see.
What?
What's wrong?
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
They weren't human!
How high is that?
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
Am I home?
Are we in Brooklyn?
I know.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
He did? When?
While you were in the shower.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
It might be for me.
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
Me neither.
What's gotten into you?
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
Sit down, Jake.
Where have they gone?
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
I no from around here.
They're awfully heavy.
For what? For seeking the truth?
Call my chiropractor.
I'm awake?
Of course it is. What else could it be?
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
I just need to talk.
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
You've seen them?
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
No.
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
He came for me, I had to run!
Cool.
The hull's imploding!
What are you gonna do, tell me?
What are you doing back?!!
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
You're a teacher.
You just keep an eye out.
But I didn't see...
Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
I thought you meant...
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
Wait around on your asses all day.  I'll need a distraction.
Okay, good tip.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
So what else is new?
Kay-em 14.
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
They can deal with this sort of thing.
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
It's okay.
My boat's neat, dad!
You got it.
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
I almost had 'im.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Michael! Come inside!
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
Just sign it, Larry.
No, it was local jurisdiction.
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
Chum?
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
It's a whale out there.
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
Anti-Shark cage.
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
Let it go, don't waste your time.
I'm okay...
And I'll drink to yours.
That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
Thanks for the message.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
Um, hi?
Leah just told me you were going with her.
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
Okay.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Excuse me?
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"?
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
You weren't even alive!
Commercials.
Oh.
I wrote that.
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
You're kidding!
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
You don't have to do that.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
I actually know this one.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
Wow! It's magical.
Nothing.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
You mean like couples?
Only the one in my pants.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
What?
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
I want to be a mommy so badly!
A hotel?
Aren't you the cool guy?
Adele for god sake please lis...
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
...Anything else?
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
What?
Almost.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
No sir.
How much do I owe you?
Wonder what all them people done made him so mad?
...Then some.
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
You wanna hear mine?
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
Up yours.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
I'm finished.
No, never. Excuse me.
Siesta.
Where would we find him?
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
...That'd be my guess.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
Oh man, that's the best.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
Yeah.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
So.
Right.
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Right now?
Yeah. Come on.
You were?
Tonight?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
I don't want you to hurt me.
I guess so.
15.
One.
Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
Mine are like my neck and my chest.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
No. I just gotta go find him.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Who, Benny's little sister?
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
Yeah I get bored.
Yeah.
And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.
But then I won't need your money.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.
I can't man.
What are you saying?
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
The door was open.
What do you want?
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
Get off me!
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
Maybe he's going to drug her?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Maybe you're reaching a bit?  I think Sanderson should be in on this. There's a reason why the killer's calling him.
What do you mean, stand out?
But a hundred men could move him.
Where is she?
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
By that time the game will be over.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
Come here.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
For what?
No Frank.  No prints.
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
--Edmonds.  I know.  You lost to Karpov in '82, didn't you?
You don't have a shred of evidence!
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
Answer the question.
I suppose you have something in mind?
Mate in five.
"Carefully".  "Carefully". "Carefully".
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
I don't think I could.
Of course.
How could you?  Unless you were there.
I tried again and got through.
Then why are you backing up?
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
But I do.
Why?
It's got to be grammatically correct.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
I don't have to go through with it either.
Me too.
Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
All directions are the same here.
Turold's son was to marry her.
There is no other way.
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
I will find her!
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
Never.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
Where the spiral begins.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
I can. Because I choose it.
Yes.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
I was hoping I might be your friend.
You and I will guard the fire.
Fame.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
Perhaps. If the pay is good.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
No.
I'd wish for a puppy.
A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
Would you desert your friends?
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
That I am, my lady.
I will seek the Fortress for you.
No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
No maze to me, my fried. It is where we take refuge when they hunt us.
Ynyr!
We had no children.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Where is he? My son.
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
You lie!
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
Why do you want to know?
Good.
130... 140...
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
No, you can't go out.
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death.  For the moment, I have none of the two!
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
Yeah, what?
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
...I got lost, Mister.
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
...And how much is it?
Where?
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
What?
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
Thank you.
Pardon?
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
The flowers... they're beautiful.
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
What it is -- is the truth.
Yes.
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
Please tell me.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
Don't be so sure.
I think it's a different place for each person.
Pacifica, California.
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three.  Are your parents home?
Yeah!
Nine.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
By car right?
God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
Walking where?
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
In a hospital.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
Yes.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
Water.
Of course.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
To death?
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Sera you are crazy.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
Don't be silly?
Sorry.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
When?
Yeah... I'd like that.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
How much, do you think?
I don't know. I'll find out though.
Where are you staying?
Sera... please go.
Get up.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
I believe you! Don't worry.
He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once --
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
No, she'd stashed it by then.
Yes.
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
I'm a man who knows what I want.
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
See?
I think so...
Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.
Spill.
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
Uh -- family.
Relation?
I'm her sister.
Yes, he is.
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish.
I wasn't gonna --
Maybe not to your face...
And you know this for a fact?
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
For a butt-head? Yes.
What do you think?
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
What happened?
I just don't understand what went wrong --
What, like on va-kay?
What?
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
I don't know --
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
So are you!
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
No.
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
Thank you.
Where's the Rock?
It's not a Theta --
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
We go out, smash 'em now?
And you... are you not also afraid?
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
Why have you brought me here?
Don't please... I'll do what you desire...
What do you want from me?
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
I didn't know... I --
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
East of Mercia?
Screwball you know, and many other of the wee folk.  We serve as escort for our grand champion, Jack o' the Green.
What!
The flower.  Bluebells.  To hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Fie on what she thinks!  You mind her claws and teeth... Cast your spell, Oona.
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise.  Dragons be deaf as tree stumps.
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Jack, don't!
Certainly understandable.
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
Easily spoken...
There aren't enough arrows.
Never mind.  Just do it!  Retrieve the arrows somehow.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
Mean you to seek him out below?
Did you bring me here to sup?
I could have struck off his head just now!
You're on your own... like a true champion.
Where?
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
They'll do nicely.
Stop complaining.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
He did run?
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
In the dark... where I join him...
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Ask away, sweet man.
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
And charmed, of course.
Wondrously so.
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
Threats won't make me love you.  Tis not the way of the human heart.
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
You do know where it is?
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
We did a lot of the wiring too.
I can't even take a shower here.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
I'm coming in.
Why are you so stupid?
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends?  Listen to music?  Masturbate together?  Talk on the phone?
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
Why would you be there?
It bugs me.
I can promise you complete privacy.
Getting high, I guess.
I'm proud of you, Sam.
I still don't know what that means.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
Good for you.
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
Can you build a house in four months?
I can die trying.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
I need you to do me a favor.
Oh.  Sorry.
She needs to be alone, I think.
You let him pierce his nose?
Where have you been for a week?!
Four days.  I left to think.
I was parked in day parking.
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
Where will you live?
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
Which?
What did he say?
What?
Does Alyssa know?
Nothing.
Who?
The payoff.
I'd be you.
You can't go because of Sam?
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
Why?
Depends on what I'd give up on.
Yeah.
He'll be gone for his birthday.
I just thought it would be nice.
Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
She's doing just fine.
He's a big one.
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
She's alright, isn't she?
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
You went to Monroe?
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
What are you talking about?
What ain't there?
So?
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
Say what?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Him?
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Well, if that's the way it is...
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
Goodnight, Ray.
Don't touch that car.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Don't make me take them away from you.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
How about some steak sauce?
No problem. Oh, boy!
You heard what the man said! Move it!
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
What were they, bootleggers?
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Shoot him, Wilkins!
What are you in for, Willie?
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Is this a joke?
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
All right. Let me out.
Sure, why not?
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
She's so nice.
A speech impediment?
No.
That pain is hunger.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Definitely.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
So I followed him...
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
You think I'm a tourist?
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
School?
My perfume?
Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
What was that?
Why would you be floating?
East Rutherford.
Yeah. The deep South.
I don't know?
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
What other food?
I am.
And I did it myself right on there.
Hurry... hurry... hurry.
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
At Carousel tonight?
Please... No.
No.  Just no.
I changed my mind.
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
I don't have much time.
Maybe you'll think of something...
You're not going, are you?
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
...But I still have the choice...?
It could be...
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
Mother and Father said so... you know?
Do you want to see Doc?
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
And all alive you say?
Oh, yes... I think...
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
As best we can.
Can I call you?
Okay...
Are you positive he knows?
We should stop seeing each other.
What deal?
Yeah.
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
Did you ask him who he is?
Not even close.
My... My head.
At your house. Don't you remember?
That's absurd.
Does it say anything on the tape?
Same one you were reading the other night?
Called? When?
You were asleep when I got home, yes.
Yeah?
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
You will.
I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Yeah?...
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
I do like you, Sheila.
Come on.
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
Don't call me brother.
I see.
Do you think they're cannibals?
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
Then I'm your man.  Come on, Toots.
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Okay, Lovey.
Horns?
Horns? What kind of horns?
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
When are you going to start?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
They were.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
No.
Yes.
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
Pardon me
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Father Perrault is dead.
You?
You talk as though you intend on staying.
I don't know.
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Shhh!
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
Why not? What's going to stop me?
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
I don't need any proof.
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
I'd go mad!
I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
The clothes?
I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
My name's Sondra.
I saw a man whose life was empty.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
I'm so glad.
I was just going to.
Cowan--
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.
No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
Mrs. Edelson?
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
Actually that's a very good question.  The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.
You heard me.  You two, especially.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
Gee.  You really think?
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
There wasn't time, sport!
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
Why not?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
What if I don't?
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
What?
Then who was he?
Found?  Where?
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
You set your patients on fire!
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
-- go blind.  I know.
Drowning.
The nation votes this week...
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
I go running down there.
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
Everybody runs.
From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
We're in motion on something.
You mind if I tag along?
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
She said...
Tell me how.
I guess that's all of it.
All right, I'll try...
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
I'm your son.  I'm you.
If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
Who said I would?
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
What safe place is that?
You're insane or you think I am.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Not.  Now.
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
What?!
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
We used to, every summer.
No.
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
What does he want with a precog?
But there's still the other two.
You're Bobby, right?
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Manhattan.
So you're models?
He's okay.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
I know.
Come on. Let's go.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Yeah? You sure?
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Max offered to stake me.
I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight.
She'll be out in a minute.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
Yeah.
Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
Where's Ricky?
Sure. Yeah.
Then what are you saying?
I don't understand.
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
You told him you liked him.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
What drill?
You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
He's not here.
Thanks.
So?
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
What are we delivering?
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
I like it.
How'd you unlock my phone?
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
What the fuck do you...
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
So we're working?
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
All the more reason.
Why?
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Three and a half hours?
I'll be a minute.
Tom. How's it going?
You want your surprise?
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
You look good, man.
'Strapped?'
It means you got a gun?
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
I hear the China Club is a laugh.
Come, now. You just got here.
Yeah.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
Four fernet.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
What?
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
Edinburgh.
A rose by any other name would --
I like you, country.
Frisk me, baby. Give me a real pat down.
You never had it.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Yeah.
What did you give it to me for then?
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
What the hell for, man?
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
There's nothing to talk about.
I love you.
I'll be away a lot.
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
We need you too!
Dear heart, I love you.
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
I'm tired of praying.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
I assumed...
What did I tell you about assuming?
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
That's right.
You put it very well.
Entirely.
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
I do know I love you.
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
You hear me, girl?
Eat lead, coppers.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.
He told you that?
Yes sir.
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
I don't know shit about you.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
[I have a friend there.]
So where do we begin?
[No!]
[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
[I am the President of La Hermanidad.]
[Ordered by who?]
[I believe you.]
[The one who transferred Pinta to their car.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
What do you mean, I'm here?
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
Maybe...
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
I'm a bargain.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
No.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
How do you think he got out?
Everywhere!
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
No.
I'm sorry.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
Then don't come.
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
She understands men.
[Yes.]
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
This is Mr. Creasy.
I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
[Is that good or bad?]
[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
That's what friends do.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
It must be one o'clock.
We just talked.
What happen?
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
It pains that they should do this.
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Yeah.
I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
Thank you.
Come on inna dining room.
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
How do you do?
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
What?
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Sure, what?
Who buys Italian meat anymore? You think my wife buys Italian meat?  She goes to the A&P, picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane, opens up a canna peas, and that's dinner, boy.
Hey, Ang'...
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
Hello, Thomas.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
Just one for a start.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
I got some.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Yeah, if I can.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
Don't stop now! Please...
A football game?
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
I think I heard about that.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
All of them?
No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
You think he won't.
Second pint.
Yes, Reverend?
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
Morning, Captain.
I used to throw the javelin.
Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy.
Nice.
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Hello.
No, thank you.
Yeah, that's the one.
Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you.
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Oh!
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
What John Doe?
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
Packs everything, including a gun.  Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
Where is she?
Go out and find her!
Both of 'em?
The heelots!
Who are they?
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe.
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Sure.
They can't, huh?  Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them.
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good peoplethey ought to run you out of the countryand I hope they do it!
Did you want to see her about something important?
Uh-huh.
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
What?
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
You're my hero.
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
You don't want to know.
You can't help me, man.
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
Is there a problem?
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
I'm ready to do it.  And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.
It was okay.
Every couple of months, huh?
Why?
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
And what if you can't live with it?
My name's Scott Roper.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
I've proved that, didn't I?
What do you want from me?
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
It's okay. We broke up.
Just now.
It's very nice.
I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
Use your imagination.
Scottie...
I've been thinking.
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
Are you going to make this hard for me?
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
Guests?
In here I am.
Yes.
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
The truth.
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
Some things never change, do they?
Once they digitized you, they added it.
Way you kiss me.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
Destination?
Speed?
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
Yeah, right.
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
Where did it originate?
In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies.  For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
There's enough for everybody!
Did I say anything?
Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
Quack like a'duck!
Well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere!
How'd you know?
Activating Power Scope!
Minimum security. You'll have everything but broads.
Charlie Luciano.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
The goddamned bastards.
Whatever you say, Boss.
What's that divided four ways?
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
But if ya can't catch the guys...
We got our boys paintin' the house next door. Around the clock. We're gonna keep old man Profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
A million bucks. In the last six months.
I'll handle the Boss.
I'll do fine.
I NEED THE TWENTY!
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
Lobster Fra Diavolo. Spaghetti with red clam sauce. Antipasto. And pastry that'll make you wanna go home and slap your sweet mama.
The kid just called me stupid.
The name's Charlie.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
You get fifteen percent.
Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
No worry, Charlie. I will kill them for you. No one will know.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
Boss, we got our own tradition. We call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
Anything ain't a very hard number.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
Nine AM! But that's - <u>twelve hours</u>.
Monkeybone...!?
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
I don't think so.
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
Isn't that Lulu?
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
Have a nice day.
I'm good.
Behind the books.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
I'd love to.
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Yeah.
Moscow.
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
Thanks very much, sonny--
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
What for? Why, suppose there's a storm--all lines are down--how you gonna get a message to Ma?
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny.
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
My first name's--Clarissa.
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
Right now--everything I own--!
Why me?
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
That infernal phone!
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
Yes, Jim.
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Aw--
Is *what* getting me down?
Why, of course.
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
Look! There it is!
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Will he *yield*?
Mr. President--
Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
How's Amos, Ma?
Just fine.
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
J-Jefferson Smith.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
Oh, but this one is so simple.
And with your help--
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
Pardon?
And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
It hasn't been easy, has it?
Terrible, thank you.
I also answer to whistles.
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Lena.
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
I mean it. I--without you, I could't've--
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
Well, I guess it's a chance.
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
A camp! Well!
Wonderful!
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
Yes, sir--
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Great!  The Government's putting dough in too many places *now*!
What do you mean? What's going on?
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Well, well!
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
Joe--what's the matter with you-- where you're concerned, I wouldn't take the slightest risk--'specially now after the great reputation you've made in the Senate. Why, look at this campaign I've started for you in all my papers. You're the logical man from the West on the National ticket--at the convention, anything can happen--
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
What do you think?
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Just a minute, Joe!
Senator Paine.
--to avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable State!
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Sometimes twice.
Oh yes, pixilated.
Any children?
No.
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
Yes!!!
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
What?
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
Now, what do you see?
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
You said I was a lady in distress.
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
Let's just walk, okay?
No, I don't mind.
A girl?
I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
Hello.
Uh-huh.
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
Hello . . .
Right.
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Me, sir?
Is that the best you've got?
Me sir?
Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
You can't?
Where?
All set.
How do you do.
Yes.
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
You're going to New York with us.
No?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
Okay, you're the boss.  When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
Well, thanks, I - uh  How do you do? What is your name?
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Not at all.
Proceed.
Thank you, Your Honor.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
The difference between them and me is I know when I've been a skunk. You take me to the nearest news- stand and I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw. Raw!
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Every man to his taste, sir.
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
I did what!
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
What, sir?
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
What's that?
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
You find it distasteful, don't you?
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
It's a pretty piece of land.
...And?
You're on your own today, honey.
Doc.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
Don't need it.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
Martin.
Do you think that's a good idea?
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
What?
No.
Really? What would it take?
Life.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
Yes.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
It's a big part of the show.
It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
No again?
How are you?
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
She's probably ten years older than you.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Jerking off?
Just you.
What about everything? How did this happen?
Did you carry a gun?
But look at me now...
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.
Yes, yes it does...
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
And how does one do that?
Excuse me?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Do you know where I can steal some?
That's one way of putting it.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
What is he doing here?
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
You will not believe it.
Try me.
I am an English woman.
I would never!
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
Oh that's comforting.
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
Not unless you call me Rick.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
I think you were jealous
You lied to me!
Way to go, Evy.
Read the inscription on the cover!
What's it look like!?
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
Do it, big boy!
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
What about Captain Amazing?
Against.
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
You're dead.
Really?
Roy.
What have they got that we ain't got?
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
My heart died a long time ago.
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
Not a chance!
But look at him... and look at us.
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
We're superheroes.
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
Definitely.
Sorry.
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
No, thank you.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
You realize what is at stake?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
I see...
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed.
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
That is correct.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
Thank you.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Lisette.
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
Are you trying to insult me?
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
Oh, you must forgive me, General Bonaparte, I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be!
Promise me.
Promise.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
I know what you're doing in there.
Will you be joining us, soon?
In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
There's probably some explanation.
Why not?
I wrote it.
What?
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
No.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Show him in.
Send him in.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
Thanks, Unc.
'Cause your lips is getting black.
This my baby.  I feel like a new nigga in this car.  I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
Why?
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
Still gonna smell it.
What's the B-G's?
What about me?
What you mean, you don't know?  Just wait here.
What are you doing here?
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
Just hold your breath.
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
Hey, Pops, I'm grown.  Can't nobody get me in trouble no more.
I'll remember.
Nothing.
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Ya'll live around here?
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
I don't know, Debo.
Rancho Cucamonga?
What?
I can't feel my legs no more.
I'll take you later.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Shut yo' ass up.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
What's he doing here?
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
I've been a bad boy.
Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant.
It was because I had this...in my pocket
Believe me, I don't blame you.  This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.
You wouldn't...
Yes, I'm listening.
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
Don't you threaten me.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
I promise.
No...kisses to you.
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
Please. Something is going to happen...
Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off.
What are you supposed to do?
You're going to go see her.
Thanks for the tip.
Fuck you!
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
It goes in that little hole.
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
Why?
A surprise?
Yeah.
It better be.
'Daddy has to go now.
Yeah.
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Dad, you're bleeding...
Yes, Dad.
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
How's your sister Pearl?
Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
John: you go fetch Ruby.  Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
Say what, Walt Spoon!
Mother, I only --
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Twenty-five wives!
You'll come right out and ask that Man of God!  Mr. Paow-well!  Clear that evil mud out of your soul!
It's a shame!
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Why?
'Cause you're too little.
John, where are we g --
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
It -- she --
Yes?
What's your name?
Because John said I mustn't.
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
How's that?
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
Answer me!
Where's she at?
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
Didn't you hear me, boy?
None of your business, Madam.
This man down at the Drugstore...
He never asked me for nothin'.
Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song.  They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills.
Great.
You do?
Okay. Hi, dad.
You know he's dead though, right?
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
I don't mean her --
'Anything funny' like what?
Like Rod Lane?
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Get into bed.
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
Well, a hat...
Yes.
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
You want this?
Or it might be the firing squad!
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
No, that's bad management.
With two f's, if you please.
The former Duchess!
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
I am, Gaston.
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
Certainly.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
Comrade.
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows.  Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
We did our best, Comrade.
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
Well, we're back home.
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Private.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
No visa.
Oh no. No visa.
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Me?
Love to.
How long does it take a man to land?
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
I'll try.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
That's a strange angle.
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
Is that customary?
And what do you do for mankind?
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all, I'm alive.
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
The telephone is ringing.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!
I always eat here.
On which boat?
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
I promise... I swear.
Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!
No speech?
All right, we'll make it red.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.
They belong to the people.
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
Huh?
No.
You haven't seen her yet?
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
She's gone, Leon.
Hello.
After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.
What?
Madame, if you...
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
At Pre Mathieu's.
Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel.
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
Yeah?  Well, I own the fucking casino.
"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
You think this is just about politics?
No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
And?
What the hell are you doing, Ehrlichman?  Screwing with the CIA?  I don't care how much he wants -- pay him.
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
But he works for the Attorney General. Only Richardson can fire him.
It's the Supreme Court, sir; you don't get around it.
That was civil war.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
That smell.  I mean, everybody suffered so much, their sons killed. They need to sacrifice something, y'know, appease the gods of war -- Mars, Jupiter.  I am that blood, General.  I am that sacrifice, in the highest place of all ... All leaders must finally be sacrificed.
That fruitcake!  What about him?
Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
Yes, you approved it, sir.
Silence!
"Security" is not strong enough.
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America.  We would lose all our friends in Latin America.
Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick Helms!  Period.
You never told him?
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
Sir?
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
I expect more from thee, Richard.
Mother, think of me always as your faithful dog ...
Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard.  Strength in this life.  Happiness in the next.
What'd you say?
I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President.  You did.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
What?
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
The old queen did it on purpose.
Who do you think is behind it?
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
Who we working for?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Her name's Sandy ...
He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
Presidents don't threaten.  They don't have to.  Good day, gentlemen.
We're gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything that's sick and evil about the Eastern Establishment.  You and your "plumbers" are gonna find dirt on this guy -- let's see him going to the bathroom in front of the American public!  And when we finish with him, they'll crucify him!
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
Oh God, I'm going to throw up.
Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
Yes.
How about Kissinger along with him?
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
Sir?
Compassionate.  Grateful.
No, sir ...
Now some people, we both know them, Al, think you can go stand in the middle of the bullring and cry, "Mea culpa, mea culpa," while the crowd is hissing and booing and spitting on you.  But a man doesn't cry.  I don't cry.  You don't cry ... You fight!
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
You don't have to go.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
Don't be ridiculous!
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
Well, that's wonderful.  So get me this "crisis" thing, Dick; I'll be glad to take a look at it.
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
How you been, Ellis?
How come're you doin that?
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more.
Try "old" on for size.
Yessir. It may be that. In a nutshell.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
That don't hardly say it. He shoots the desk clerk one day, and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel.
You ain't heard from him?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
He won't neither. He never has.
He can take all comers.
I don't know...
I don't know. He ought to...
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Yessir.
My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
Yes Sheriff.
You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
No.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
At the gettin' place.
I need to know that.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
What're you doin', baby?
Goin' out.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
What did you tell him?
She'll be all right.
I know where the money is.
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Where does he work?
Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.
In the truck.  I'll get it.
Not a bleep.
Why would I care where you're going.
Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
I said you don't know what you're talking about.
All right. Heads then.
...Where you want me to put it?
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
You on all night?
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
Let's just call it square.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
No. You don't understand.
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
I don't mean braze.
Were you in Nam?
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
I don't know.
Are you in the service?
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
You know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
No... what about your sister?
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Yes... maybe it was.
I ran back in to get the phone.
What's so special about it?
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Uh-huh.
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
That's horrible!
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
You made out alright.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
The one you were telling me about?
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
He has a wife?!
God, that's awful!
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
He is real.
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
No, almost never.
But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
You should have a little faith in people.
I have to leave now.
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
Deranged. That would be the right word.
Huh?
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
If we're for real?
You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
Of what?
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
Like... us?
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain.  They don't owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!! WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
It is, if you like idiots...
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
I SAID FORGET IT!
Would you say she was ambitious?
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
I swear to God!
Her show?
All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
In any state.
Vernon T. Waldrip.
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
That's not my ring.
Well, we need that ring.
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
Well, but Pete...
...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eighty-four years old.
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity-two weeks from everywhere! Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets!
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Great.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
I wrote. Not every week...
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
I don't mean anything by it.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do.
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!
No, sir!
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
It's important, sir!
I didn't call you anything before that.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
No, sir.
What are you tired from?
How late?
You what?
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Yeah? Why're you here?
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
I don't want you to move.
When I'm good and ready.
No. Is that what you want?
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
I know that.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Yeah. All week long.
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
But it can't wait.
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
I can't.
NOT THAT ONE?!
This is insane.  I'm outta here.
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Different tables.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
Shut up and let me think.
And we're never getting in.
Can we come in?
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
It's okay, Raoul.
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
I don't think so, but I love her album.
Open the door.
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
Why did the chicken cross the road?
I don't know, why?
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
"Titanic."
Blue is phones?
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
What if I keep dropping?
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
What are doing with yours?.
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
You know it. Stay Black...
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Look this is bull...
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
They couldn't have thought this up for themselves.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the Black community. It's their power base...
Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
Alone...
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
No man. Gonna walk.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
Just the legit shit.
If you got something to say, say it.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
Late summer.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
You call that a compliment?
It's a start.
His journals, letters, maps, books...
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
Yes, sir.
What unit?
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
Who cared for your wounds?
Colonel will do.
Prisoner exchange.
They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night.
Yes, sir.
Perhaps.
Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
No...
Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause.
Cheraw Falls.
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
You know what happened.
That's not enough.  Tell me.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
Yes.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
Gabriel.
Thank you.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
How many men have we seen die?
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
Goodbye, Harry.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
Yes... you will wait.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.
That bad?
But father, they might come this way.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Bite?
It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
Am I really gonna have my own room?
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Of course I will.
I will. Come and kiss me.
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
I'm not climbing that.
You're telling me.
Wouldn't wash?
Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie.
It's Ellie's cat.
Remember.
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
Aye, aye, sir!
You can't.  I can.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
Track you down and --
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
Men!  Are you up for it?
I want you to leave.  And never come back.
Boy overboard!
What?
Yes, father.
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
It doesn't!
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
More to drink!
Yes, the rum is gone.
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
Only a little.
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
No worries there.  She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
Jack!
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
Speak.
Oh no.  You're not like me.  In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
That remains to be seen.
What I asked you earlier?
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
Been out for six months now.
A cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men.
All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!
The nanobot.
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
What did you want my hair for?
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
The head shrinker at the prison.
Let's go.
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
Don't worry, four eyes.
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance
For the letters, of course.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and  
You don't wear garters!
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
How-di-do.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
Of course I am Stewart.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
O-o-oh, I get you  All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne?
You're acting like a child.
Oh, hello Mother!
Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.
You're the Tribune man?
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
Yeah - go on.
Yeah.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
That's so.
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
But not for me!  Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.
Quite so. Quite.
Outside!
Yes, of course. I'll get it for you
And the rest of us are truck horses?
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
There you are!
My mistake - she's glaring.
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
Surely, come right in.
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
That's putting it crudely, but
It's all right. Bring him in.
All right, Grandma
I beg your pardon?
You try it.
Yes sir.
Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
... It's a pretty short trip.
I don't know.
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
I was in a bowling-alley.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
Lover's Lane!
It's six-thirty ...
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
It was accessible to everyone.
Very well ...
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
I thought the books were blank?
Yes.
What color is that hedge of yours?
The other one?
The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
What are you doing?
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
I don't know.
Neither do I.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Can we do any better?
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
What do you mean?
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
Really? It seems so fattening.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Sure.
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
And you're sure about this?
No. You baked them for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
They just grow like that?
No I won't. I swear.
I like it too.
We'll get you fixed up in no time.
That's right.
Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ...  You know ...
Re-runs?
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
No you're not.
I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Yes.
Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
Just listen to me ...
Christmastime.
What's the rush?
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
So you can't talk to me?
Well it's just not true. We wouldn't be looking at you -- why are you wearing this suit? Did you say hello to your brother in law's?
So you're coming tonight, right?
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
...please, I just don't want it....
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Why?
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
What?
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
You're so scared.
...yes...
I'm fine. Who is this?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
I know I did. But I don't.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
It was cool last night.
....this is your mistake....
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
It's fine. It was fun, though.
I saw a picture of you.
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
Really?
....Hi.....
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
Yeah.
Yeah.
No I didn't say that.
Nothing.
What did he want?
Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.
Oh that's great.
Yes no not really.
...yeah...
This is Lena.
Ok.
It's Barry.
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
Yeah.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
Yeah.
Just have you for one second, please.
I cut myself.
I didn't do that.
That's fine.
What do you mean?
What's that for?
No one will know your name.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
What?
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
I think you have a call?
Ok. You're connected.
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
Yes I'm fine.
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What?
Please don't do this.
Yes.
No.
What is this, man?
I'm sorry.
Yes. Sorry.
Ok.
Don't puss out.
I won't.
That's it.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
What did you say?
Put him through.
I'm afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're the laughing stock of all France. But -- on a happier note --
Not now, or we're both done for.
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
By whom? The Marquis?
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
And --?
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
THEN BUGGER ME!
And my chaise -- am I being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass --
-- water! --
A man after my own heart...
Why was it you never took her by force?
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
And --?
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
But I am history.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
No. But tell him I would.
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
Of course.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
So I've been told.
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw, to hell with you!
Nuts. She only cares about the money. She thinks I'll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w...  will.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
It's not really--
This picture--
Not for me.
I don't want you to--
Sir?
Please be quiet.
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
A delicious amalgamation, is it?
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Like a bug.
Who the hell's Manolete?
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
This better be good
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
I expected more from you.
Don't do this
I don't have it anymore?!
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
And what does he see?
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
Uh huh.
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
Get out.
Again
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
Then find another theater
"Your movie" -- I am so sick of that! It's your movie -- but it's his life! Did you ever think about that?! Did you ever think about that old man and Marion having to watch as you tore them apart?!
Happy birthday.
It was the best, kid
Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
Make it on his own? Does he know the kind of money involved? I mean the real money. He thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? We're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? A nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? Is he really crazy? Listen, Joey, you understand, you tell him. I don't care how great he is or how colorful. He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants to. He ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. I'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
We did what we had to do. Tommy don't forget. Sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if Tommy don't die.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
What?
But you said "you."
So what?
Stop it. What're you, crazy?
Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.
What time is it?
Yeah. At night.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
That's all right. He don't mind.
Now take your panties off.
Oh, Jake.
Who asked you?
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
Yeah.
What did I say?
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
I don't know.
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
It don't look right.
This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
Oh. When are they expected home?
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
-- until yesterday morning.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
You think he's getting out of here?
You sure it belongs to his wife?
Your Lisa?
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
Who said I was getting rid of it?
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
Why should I?
Well, I only quote from the best.
That's abnormal.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
And some man will lose his.
Isn't he a salesman?
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
What?
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
How much do you think you'll need?
Not a word.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
Who buys them? Tax collectors?
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
I think it's enchanting.
Of course not.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
Do you think I consider this recreation?
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is, yet.
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
Who was the trunk addressed to?
He's washing down the bathroom walls.
Phone number?
Friend of yours?
They always live.
What?
We got to do something.  Don't we?
You see any cops?
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
Say, listen--
Really, Frank?  When was that?
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
Head-shrinker?
I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
I just don't want trouble.
What's a chickie-run?
I hitched.
Who has?
It's me!
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
What?
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
I need it.
They like you.  Okay?
All right, darling.
I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
Good Lord!
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
Try the desk.
I bet you see right through me, don't you?
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Yes, ma'am.
"Life is crushing in on me."
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Yeah--why--
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
I'm never going back.
You decide, darling.  Remember our budget.
Well--we're newlyweds.
See, we're very modern.
Hi.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Are you?
You disappointed?
They're killing him!
Talk to them!  Heavens!
I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
Hi.
Must have a way with stationery.
Read a lot about you, Nick.
What are you doing here?!
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
What, he should see me help you catch him?
We sell children's toys --
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
What's going ON!!!
Nick --
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
Nick died for me....
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
Canada.
Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain.  I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
They're truck drivers.
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Nick...
Get your own room.
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
No, you can't --
The hell I can't.
I never worked at no casino.
Bam Bam.
I don't know.
Five million?
I said, who the hell made the map?
I'm gonna need some money.
I'm no threat without a gun.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
And where they hide the real money.
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
Five years. Since it opened.
How long ago was your makeover?
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
I promise you, I didn't know!
What?
And some pecan pie.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Five years, Nicky. Five years.  I just want to go home.
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
Tell Ashley... I...
YOU TELL HER!
NICK!!!
You gave them me.
I... sorry, Mister...
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
How do you know all this?
What?
Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me.
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
How can you tell?
Did the two of you talk?
The Brewers.
I can do that.
What for?
Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick.
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin."
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
Down to my car.
Joe.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
No shit?
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
So what is it?
I think he's just passed out.
He asked.
This is what he was doin'.
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
His letters will keep.
Thanks.
Go on. Tell me more about her.
I'll make the soap myself.
But the rest is right.
Maybe it's better that way.
What?
It's going to Sonora.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
Nice.
Yes.
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
There's only two of them now.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have, but I know a sight more about people and I wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
That's a good girl.
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
I don't like to see you go.
And we're running out of that.
There's still tomorrow morning.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
He certainly could. About a month.
Who brought you here?
Put on another one.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Good night, Steve.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.
Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, "I'm sorry," and you said, "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass." I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy.
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Never happened!
Really? That's amazing.
Hey, I have an idea...
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
So, I guess I can go now.
You sure?
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
Shhh!
Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.
No. Keep rubbing.
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Uh, uh.
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
Don't touch me!!
What's this?
How are we going to get them all up there?
Professor!
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
Even in the bathroom?
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
Are you sure it's not the tape?
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
And sexy.
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
My holy water.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
I don't feel like rewinding it!
This is so silly. 
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
That's nice.
Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.
What a mess.
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
COCKSUCKER! 
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
Are we leaving?
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
What's he know?
Yeah - sure.
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
She could use a hundred dollars.
I'll give you a check.
I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
The people at the restaurant?
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
Who the devil is he?
It's what I should have done yesterday. I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest.
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want - surrender herself to the police  stand trial  I don't think he knows.
Not from me.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
I don't know.
But you're always at the library.
I can imagine.
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
She was my patient.
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
I think it's time.
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna -
Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
Graham Dalton.
Curious.
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
Lawyers.
Okay, I will!!
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
Can we look at one?
What about sex?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
You know?
It won't. Are you ready?
Does he go down on you?
About who?
Yes.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
Don't you get lonely?
No, you're not.
But if you were?
I can't tell you like this.
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
You're not answering me.
And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
No.
I'm okay. It's okay.
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
There's nothing to know, Ann.
Why don't I believe you?
Loud.
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
What upsets you about that?
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
Did you do anything?
I take it you've never masturbated?
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
I have a pretty good idea.
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
Fine.
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
Apparently.
Why did you do that?
He wouldn't do that.
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
You couldn't do it, period.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
I don't want to discuss it.
Then why do you keep asking about it?
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
How long will it take?
Do I sit or stand?
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
Your first sexual experience.
Were you disappointed?
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
So make an exception.
Cynthia, I don't know.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
How about inviting me over to dinner?
I like the way he dresses.
What do you mean?
It hurts that you would say that to me.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
How about straightening up the living room?
Graham.
God, you... you're mean.
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
Really. How'd it go?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
So is my wife, asshole!!
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change.
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
Sure.
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
Well? Supper at my place?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
So who changes?
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
That was my father's idea... private practice. He wanted to set me up -- I couldn't say no. But he's dead now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I gotta do research. Look at that beautiful stuff...  ...lookit it!
You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
IT'S TIME FOR BYE-BYES IT'S BEEN A GREAT DAY THANKS A HEAP NOW IT'S TIME FOR EVERYONE TO GO TO SLEEP
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
Nothing.  Just...memories!
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Shove it, Ralph!
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
I NEED SOME
I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.
F for...
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Bye.
So I guess that's it.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Good. How're you?
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
Well, in that case...
I can't help the traffic.
Just tell me.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
It's not even a mile.
So you're going to stop acting?
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
Been divorced for a year now, bud.
I will.  See ya!
Okay! Jesus!
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
Yeah.
Nope.
Thanks, Jack.
What do you think's going on?
Could be anything.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Shut up.
You have to tell me --
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
Uh-huh.
What?
The plan is... you go.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
I feel like driving.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it.  Right now. Hurry up...
Oh. You mean... today?
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Sure.
Yeah.
Got it.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
Ken.
Yeah.
I told you I need a drink.
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
Only for pee or poop.
Don't touch him.
My ballet recital.
Good.
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
That's right.
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
I'm close.
Have they said anything about our area?
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
Yes.
It's old Morgan.
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
Dad.
They win.
What was the first thing?
Yeah.
My partner and me robbed the bank in Turley and headed out with a posse on our tails. My partner there caught one a ways back, and I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn canyon. You're Dawson, ain't you? I'm Tex LaRue.  Used to ride with Ry Morris. You know him. Well, Andy Sims told me there was a hideout here, so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind.
No money, eh?
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
It was my fault.
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
McKendrick's men got him.
Is he alive?
I just came out to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
This is a brutal land.
You must have known that before you came.
I already did that.
I'll be long gone.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
I expect.
All right, you buy me a drink.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
Don't press your luck, Carter.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
Because they enjoy it.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?
Maybe you could run it without Stella.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
Please.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Why not?
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
"Forever".
She'll drive herself.
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
Well, shoot it on the last day.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
About now.  Would you like a drink?
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
Where are you?
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
Yes, call me Simone.
Simone?
How about the nudity?
I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And what may I ask brought this on?
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.  She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable.  I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.
Simone!
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
Don't be.  It was worth it.
"Straw God" changed my life.
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
I know plenty of boys.
You know me -- married to my work.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
I don't understand.
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
You know what I'm talking about.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
--Do I know you?
If it's okay with you?
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
You mean aneurysm.
I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.
Something I want?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
No.
No gas... Hey, that's good.
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
No.
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
I guess she did.
What?
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
They did?
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
S-ssstop that!
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
...Chicken blood? Who said it was... "chicken blood"?
Could take a little while, though.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Slut.
I thought you said two hundred.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Pardon?
I don't think so.
Not while you're driving.
Yeah?
Wait a minute --
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
I was getting 'warmed' up.
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
What'll we do?
You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.
Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
And that makes you look like a squid?
Sorry.
Just checking out the lights.
Just block the doors, any way you can.
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
Hell, I was game!
What?
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
You're my princess, aren't you?
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Hey, look!
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
But you could get killed, right?
Driving?
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
Seriously?!?
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
See ya, Kate.
You sure do.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
Not for long, you ain't.
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
Then don't.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
I'm cucumber cool.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Of course. Yes.
No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
Mortal.
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
Ww... uh...
Yeah, why.
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
I said I got his machine.
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
I am. Yeah.
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that...
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
What are you doing here?
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
-- he's doing it then, huh --
A million flat.
How are we on time...?
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
Her?  Who are you talking about?
We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
Whose side are you on?
Who was it?
What was it?
Dead?
What is it?
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
Who are you trying to convince?
No.
Human beings can die.
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
No.
Her oxygen would have run out.
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
I'll go with you.
To calm your anxiety.
And tonight?
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
You don't know?
Stop.
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
Don't call me that.
I'm disgusting.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
I can't stay here.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
Please.  Don't.
He won't.
It's an experiment.
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
No, Ma'am.
Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
Very nice.
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
Stop being nuts!
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
You take care.
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
What are you talking about?
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
I'll be right up.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
What was that?
You heard me.
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
What're you talking about --
I'm all right.
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
Does it make you... hard?
I asked for the man in charge...
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
Is she injured?
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
Why should she come in?
Yeah, I think so.
We're gonna pass the street.
Be nice.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
Oh, sure.
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Fine.
A spider.  Eight legs.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
I hate--
But you like that in a man?
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
Oh, God, I forgot to--
I'm here...
You sure about all this?
I'll introduce you.
Yes.  Do you have a date?
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Bonkers.
They never caught on.
They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
Jawohl!
I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
Looks good outside.
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
Okay, Security -- what happened?
How much more do we have to take from him?
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Jawohl.
Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
So what? There's other women!
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
Do Jimmy Durante!
Animal! Got a little something for you!
It's that song, Harry!
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
Says who?
You can tell Father Murray to --
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
Here. Take them.
Who's the guy, Schulz?
Just don't drool on it.
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
Then when is he going to Engineering?
Thanks for pointing that out.
What do you mean?
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Wherever he wanted to be.
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
Oh, of course.
No, no. Thank you.
I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one  I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.
When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
What do you want?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  Good luck.
There are no other ships in the system.
Aye, sir.
Lock phasers and return fire!
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Not from here, no.
I went wrong.
My readings indicate great instability.
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
Not exactly.
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
I don't understand.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
Aye, sir!
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
Yes. And I know you.
Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
She's to be decommissioned.
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
... A cloaking device?
Come on!
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Who is this?! How dare you --

You should take the Vulcan, too.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
He asked you not to grieve...
... Yes...
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
Success, my lord.
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
I'm not a drama critic.
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
And who am I hiding from?
It's like the Garden of Eden...
All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
But we can't just sit here -- !
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
I didn't expect anything.
Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
Raise them --
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
Inoperative.
I shall avenge you --
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
KHAN!
Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
We'll be going to warp speed --
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Sensors, Captain?
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
I would not presume to debate you.
The power of creation --
It would explain a great many things --
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Scotty, can we make it inside?
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
Because... there was no way to win.
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Battle stations.
Ready, sir.
Never, sir.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Why don't I?
Gillian --
It'll come back to him.
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
That's crazy!
Cramps.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
... Best shot...?
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
No, <u>my</u> name.
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
... You're very perceptive.
You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Thank you, Admiral.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
But you said toxic.
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Ah... The giants.
Yes?
I see.
... I see.
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
They did, Admiral.
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Put them on screen!
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Sill? What else would I be working with?
The keyboard... How quaint.
That's the ticket, laddie.
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
What's the rush?
Really?
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
No one's ever asked me that before.
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
Captain, Geordi...?
I was in an isolation suit collecting physiometric data on Ba'ku children. My last memory is going into the hills, following a boy...
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
How about a passive radiation scan?
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
Good luck. Dougherty out.
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
How many people would it take... before it becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand. A million?
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
I don't believe it happened that way.
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
You got me, Commander.
Eighteen minutes...
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
Sir?
Beam him out!
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
Yew-cheen chef-faw... emphasis on the 'cheen' and the 'faw'...
Why was Data assigned?
"Environmental concerns", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...
Good question.
What...?
Was I doing something to your neck?
No children?
... I'm not sleeping well...
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Yes...
I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
There should be some kind of manual release...
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
Always am.
Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
I'm very sorry.
You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
Some.
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
That's impossible.
You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.
On screen.
Life signs?
Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
No, sir.
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
Where the hell are they going?
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
The charge is murder.
That's the question -
We're not finished.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Have you saved patients as "barely" alive as he was?
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
Take them away.
Yes.
I am.
They'll be here...
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
There's a reward for your death.
Where do we come in?
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Right -
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
When does this conference start?
You have personally -
Where?
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
You can't prove any of this...
Essential as a resource. Praxis is their key energy production facility.  Send to Klingon High Command: "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require assistance</u>?"
What is it?
What's left of it.
That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
I want this ship searched from bow to stern. Lieutenant Saavik, you are in charge. Start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...
Why?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency.  Theres no crying in Starfleet.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
He turned out all right.
Soon then.  Ill save the last dance for you.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
On my way.
Yes, sir.
While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!
Yes.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
Do you have a name, sir?

The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
I don't believe that, sir. Weve shared many disappointing journeys.
I don't know.
How could I not?
You sick bastard!
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
Weve got him!
There's more... as always. He's Reman.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
Not yet, Mister Worf.
On screen.
Aye, sir.
Thank you, sir...
Counselor?
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
I have no reason to.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
Were we always explorers?
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
Its too late.
I am.
Runs in the family.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
I came this far alone ...
Now go. I have some personal business.
It is beautiful.
Where's that?
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
I just retired.
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
Don't... don't do this... please...
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
Shit?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Candy.
The car will stop?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
It was a mistake.
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
Yes. Sing some more.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
I don't want you to be hurt.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
I gave you a baby last night.
You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
I understand.
I will.
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
Doesn't make sense.
Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter.
I did.
No.
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
Twenty-eight years.
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
What's all this squid shit?
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
Maybe later.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
Maybe.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
Talk to me about costs, here.
Thanks, Max.
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
But this is a bad one.
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
W'sup, Max?
Looks like she was holding out.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
I won't say anything.
I know.  So, I'm working for this puke, right?  And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
You got froggy on me a couple times.
Naawww.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
I always do.
Strickland.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
You'll see.
Black.  Jack.
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Wants to share.
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
So the guy's not a sicko.
This tie doesn't go with blue!
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
You better keep a low profile for a while.
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
You sure?
It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
Aw, Mom!
Take the tape to the cops.
There's more to this whole thing than you think.
Um... he was older.
Besides that.
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
You got that right. Low became obsessed with the Green River murders, the case had been inactive for ten years at that point. He argued the Green River Killer had actually become Suspect Zero, this master murderer who killed without pattern, killed literally hundreds of victims -- male, female, old, young, straight, gay -- and who was still killing, even though there were no bodies. It went against everything we knew. Low became increasingly paranoid. Every suspect was potentially Suspect Zero. Anybody tried to talk sense into him, he'd accuse them of being out to get him. Deputy Director Koessler was "out to get him." The decision was made to relieve him.
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you.
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.
Hi. What's in the case?
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Look...
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
What do you want from me?
Yes.
He had an orange hat on.
Put a BOLO out on that.
What about his killer?
What?
MyDick.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
Go ahead.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
As far as the public knows, Richard Low is dead. And he will stay dead until we kill him.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
The Academy, then CIIAC.
How long have you been downtown?
You want to have dinner?
"Gone live?"
Sex.
What's this country coming to?
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
I've been thinking about this.
Oh.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
How are we going to find him?
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
So you went underground?
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
Murman!
You're money, baby.
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Yes. Like the quiche.
Not lately.
To do what?
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
You haven't told then, huh?
Well, no harm done. This is Lisa. I'm sorry, I never got your names...
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
Who's your booking agent?
Hey, at least it's not Goofy.
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
Yeah, hold on.
There's the rub.
I mean, I need the money.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
Oh no?
I didn't mention her once today.
I do. Good for you, man.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
Well, let's hit that party.
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
It's unbelievable.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
Not well.
Rejected?
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
S'up Trent?
I don't know...
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
What are you talking about? Vegas?
Tonight, baby.
Shut up -- yes you are. Now listen to Tee. We'll stop at a cash machine on the way.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
Vegas!
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
I know she's coming back.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
I know. I know.
I gotta use the phone.
She thought you were money.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
Michelle went for you, right.
This version doesn't have fighting?
It starts at eight...
Which one?
Minnie Pearl.
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
Chelios to Roenick...!
...Is he brown?
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
But your daughter is still alive.
America has been good to me...
Go back to your house and wait for me...
Shut up.
BA FA GOULE YOU!
Yeah.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
No, just you and Paulie.
The gun will be there.
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
Sure.
You understand him better than anyone.
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
But you needed a drink first.
How did you find out?
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Beautiful all over, eh?
The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
Mama, no.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
I'm German-Irish.
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
Mike, why am I out?
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
They're talking to themselves.
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
Who is he?
Then Luca turned to the other man...
...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.
How do you do.
He'll be OK.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Wake me up when you come to bed?
Don't ask me.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
One of them fingered the old man.
To the city.
The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
I do renounce him.
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
You're unlucky.
And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink.
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
Bird!
Your parents met her.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
What?
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
It's Freddie. Let me in.
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
I think it might hurt her to know.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
He's not a man, he's a god.
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
What about Cortina?
I'll go and see what's the matter.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Dickie?
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Why? When?
What are you going to do now, Tom?
Oh Marge.
No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating.
Right.
Is Freddie in Rome?
You know what -- I am.
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf? 
And tomorrow?
Ten thirty?
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
It's fantastic.  I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Do you want me to stick around?
What do you want to change about this moment?
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
November, I thought.
November 7th is my information.
31 people.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
You have, yes.
My name is Travis.
Where do you live?
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
What hours do you work?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
What do you mean?
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
But... Betsy...
Thank you, Travis.
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
The kind with a brush.
That's the guy. Eddie calls him up and says, "Hey, what do you want me to do. I'm over here at Poly Prep. I got a girl in the back and she doesn't have the fare. She wants me to come in back and collect. What should I do?
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
What's your real name?
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
You want to make it like this? 
Do they drug you?
You can do it in my mouth.
But that one night?
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
What do you mean?
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
You want to work uptown nights?
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
Military record?
No.
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
I was in the Army too.  And I'm good with crowds.
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Show it to me.
The taxi life, you mean.
I know.
Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
What is happening?  Where's Mason?
Well yes I suppose ...
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side.
Whatever happens.
Okay.  What's the second thing?
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
Oh...
What?
Well, there's got to be a way...
Oh.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
That's... pretty frightening.
Guess I must've learned.
Well, then, as what did you go?
I do.
A statement?
Listen to me!  The young man in there...
By all means.
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
Good to meet you.  Again.
Thanks.
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
Harry, son.  Harry.
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
Ah.
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.
Did you... did you...
What.
Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
I... no, I... I just can't...
Jesus.
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Thirty a month.
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
So, it is a blacklist.
Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
Oh...
Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max.  Okinawa, I believe.
No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Thank you.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
If you have some, I'd...
I think so.
How'd you happen to come here?
Different?
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
Because she was afraid.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
That's up to you.
Look.
They're birds!
Take them.
Yes?
Your brother told me.
Darling, of course I do!
What's the matter with them?
Why are they trying to kill people?
The little Brenner girl.
Lois!
Where does he live?
Right across the bay there.
Yes?
See them two big trees across there?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
D'you want me to order one for you?
Daniels.
Okay.
Yes.
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
What happened?
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
Lovebirds, I see.
Yes, Mother.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
I don't know.
Maybe we ought to leave.
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
If they are?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
What good will they do?
Cathy. At the school.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Yes.
Monday?
Well, I...
I understand completely, sir.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
No, of course not.
Aren't these lovebirds?
Doesn't what make me...?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
Yes.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
I don't give a damn what you believe!
I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
I have several jobs.
What do you do?
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
What'll it say?
Really? Tell me about it.
After the gulls attacked.
Don't let's take any chances.
It may not be last week again for a long long time.
What do you suppose it is?
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
Then let's go. Now!
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
Can't you please finish your drink?
Good morning.
Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.  Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
You've no thought of going there?
An old acquaintance, eh?
I wanted to see the white horse --
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name.  Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too.  But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those things. Look --
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
We have never been friends.
I have other means of sustenance.
The Resurrection business? That may end sooner than you think. New laws may come.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
Nearly a year.
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
He must leave me alone.
Where are they?
Tell her... we'll get him.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
Good thing in a situation like this.
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
No! Why are you haunting me?
I don't want to see!
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
I mean Lauren.
I want you... to bend over.
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
Looks like you have them both on.
About you.
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
That's what I came to see you about.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
What do you mean, dear?
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars.
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Well, sure, but--
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
I'm afraid my people haven't.  I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
Warm and friendly and intelligent--  You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.
May I walk out with you?
Did you believe what he told you?  I have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason.
How long will I live?  That no one can say.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
As a matter of fact, we're almost certain that ghouls and werewolves occupy high positions at City Hall.
The Prince of Darkness.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
Where's Star, David?!
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
No.  Stick around.
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Chill out Edgar.
Sam, don't --
Lots more where he came from.
Good!
Whatcha doin' over here?
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Great.  I wanna get some new comics.
You better not like him too much.
For what.
Okay.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Get out, Mom!  Run!
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
You've heard this story before?
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Mom!
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
I thought you said they needed discipline?
No... no, everything's different now...
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt.
No.
I don't know.
Huh?...
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...
I don't know who to trust.
When we were up poking around his place... I found this...
But...
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
A day or so ago... I guess.
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
He's dead.
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
MacReady...?
He's one of them.
Hear what?
What?!
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
I'm so sorry, Kalen.
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
What happened?
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Yes... Thank you.
This has to end.
So you take their best...
A man can change his history.
No...
I'm a foolish man.
And why not?
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
What?
Sorry... I was distracted.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
Dance with me...
I need... to talk to you.
All right...
So it's astronomy now, is it?
God, and I'm running late --
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
I care more about my life.  And yours.
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
That machine --
You can see so many here.
We all have that dream.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
Or mud carriers.
Learning was important?
Yes, sir, he --
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
What are your people called?
No...
Why?
I suppose so.
We don't know.
My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends, your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
Then don't.
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
You killed him?
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
Oh yeah, what'd he say?
I never touched your father! I swear!
Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
Jackie.
After I...
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
[Beat] I don't know.
It's Sunday.
Ok. Ssh. Rest.
Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
I still don't either, even after all these years.
[Beat] We will.
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
2004.
Maybe.
How...how do you know?
You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it.
Great, get in. We'll switch off in a bit.
[Beat] Thanks.
Thanks.
[Beat] I do it.
Have you always been a waitress?
You remember it?
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
Hon?
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
Yes, sir.  I know.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
I have no problem with that.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
What's wrong?
That sounds nice.
I'm a robber.
You're a bank robber?
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Christ, sure... yes!
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Am I in trouble?
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Get the car!
Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
He said "Okay, Thelma.  I just wanted to know you were alright.  I hope you're havin' a good time.  You sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time.  I love you, honey."
He's a real piece o' work.  I wish you could meet him.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
Let's get it over with.
Just past Boise City.
Idaho?
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Gosh.  It sure is.
What'd I say again?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
Yes, Thelma?
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
I know.  I know what you mean.  I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Go?
Hi there!  You alright?
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Well once. Mary.
I don't know.
Well why don't you look her up?
Yeah, right.
Why not?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
Never met him.
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Got cash.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
Who?
Call you back.
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
Big time.
Am I?
Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
The sawbones?
I work with retards.
Have you seen it?
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
Well, I know you're busy...
You want her dead, don't you?
No, not at all.
Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
Three different guys?
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Did you study under Kim Greene?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
I never said that.
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
'That right? Good for you.
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
He's no Steve Young.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Where's Puffy?
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Really? I never got a message.
Oh... are you... ?
Oh great, I ran out.
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.
Okay.
You got what stuck?
It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
What?! No please, sir --
No, that's really unneces --
Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
Admiral, I asked you a question.
What --
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
It shouldn't have. But it did.
Says what, Kenny?
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
Yeah.
There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.
They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. There's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. They're going to be shot at, plain and simple.
Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
Seven.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
She's that subtle?
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
He knows me?
He said he doesn't know.
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
A what?
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
What'd you expect to hear?
And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
Well, it was just a dream, I --
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
Stop.
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
That's right. Turn around.
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
Move it, Magdelana.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.
No. No, no. Thank you.
-- your father was part Sioux.
Washington sent ya. I know that.
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
And on to a bigger one with you?
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
Um. You.
Too aggressive?
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
Uh hum.
How about what?
You're an animal.
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Why?
That's not what I hear.
You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part.
I want it back.
I like to play "reality".
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
How does it go?
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
What is he doing?
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
I can recover. Hold on!
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
I want him!
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
You saved our lives. You did it!
I think I can work it out on my own.
Some guys never get it back.
I lost.
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
For the same reason you are.
I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers.
He was by the book, all the way.
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Sleazy...and demure.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
That's right.
Arrest that woman!
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
On his way.
Well don't.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.
Up to the right.
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Are you saying she liked it?
He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars.
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
Split up.  Find him.
Poor baby.  This is getting to be an obsession.
Yeah, sweetheart?
Just think about it.
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
Some men just tried to kill me!
Bullshit.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
Bullshit.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
Let me go!
Blondes.
I don't remember you.  I don't remember us.  I don't even remember me.
Like what?
You two-faced-bastard.
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
Ready as we'll ever be.
Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
Well, I was wondering if we could...
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
Could we make it to the mountains?
Do not talk to the driver.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Why?
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
A man who plans ahead.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
I'm gonna help you.
Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons.  No way they could stop it.
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
We got a plan!
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
You bet.
What?
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
Yeah.  One, two, three...
It does.
An hour after you picked it up!
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
Correct.
Complain to the Bar Commission.
Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers.
If you'd had the sense to ask for my help, I might've helped you. But you've probably scared Chuckie Roeder off for good, I have a whole bunch of jumpy employees to handle and you're both going to be on your way. Now.
Oh really?
Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...
-- The Nazi he knifed?
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
I feel much better now.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
I followed her from the courthouse.
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
I don't have time to read every word in every report, I'm too busy getting killed in court... Meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works!
A number of them are dead, three are in prison, one's a waiter... Two -- you'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the Chamber of Commerce.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
What went down?
I'd have that checked, Mr. Reynard.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
Calls for speculation.
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
You're trespassing into the area of witness protection, Mr. Dowd. Such showboating puts lives at risk.
-- Eddie told you?
So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer?
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
I want you to kill for me.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
An old woman and her grandson.
Was there an argument?
Oh.
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
How do you figure?
What do you mean?
A blue rose.
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
That's good.
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
Faulty wiring.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
Well, why not?
Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon.  James is the one.  He loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
Call me.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
No.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
Fill 'er up.
Who would do that?
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
Not now.
This afternoon?
What's going on?
Hiking?
What are you afraid of? What people think?
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
I forgot my books at school.
What?
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
Sure you do, it's good for you.
Good night, sweetheart.
A special friend?
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
No.
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
I always thought you knew it was me.
Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
That's right.
What did you say?
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
As far as we know, nothing.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
Yes.
How did you settle on the amount?
You thought it was just.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
You know what that would mean?
Yes.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
Just as you are, Sir...
No.
I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Nothing further, your Honor.
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement...
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
Yes... I... yes.
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
Do you know who her doctors were?
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
...things change.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Exception!
I changed my room at the Hotel.
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Do you want me to go...?
Yes.
Well, then what are you doing here?
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
Who told you that?
You, you don't under...
Yes.  We've all got to let go.
I have to talk to you.
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I didn't do it, Mister.
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
It's locked.
It's a long road that has no turning.
Don't touch anything.
What?
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
Right.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Oh shit, what's today?
I can't talk now.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
The 'History'...?
She told me.
What?
Yes, that's correct.
We, we were rather busy...
Me, too.
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
Let's go.
We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
Come on out!  We're friends!
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
Welcome to California!
I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
He was just here!
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
What?
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Read me some?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
Yes.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
They've become what you wanted. They're a crew.  That's why he came.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
North, north-east.  And Dick, please make a note of our final position.
Yes sir.
Believe what?
I just can't believe it.
Anonymous.
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
I guess.
I'm pissin' fire man.
They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
But that's not the point...
Yes.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
'Cause they're getting a divorce.  That's why they sent me here.  My sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
Who?
I couldn't.
All stop on the engine.
The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
Of a fight he can't win out here.
That is unfortunate.  We'll have to take him with us.
No.
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
Oh, praise the lord.  Relax everybody.  Everything is under control.  The jug head's going to think of something.
Shut up donut.
No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
It hurts too much to care.
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
No.
You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
They are much more than that, sir.
For killing a dolphin.
No.  I didn't.
Artie? That you, Artie?
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
Thank you. It's listeners such as yourself who made me want to get up out of that hospital bed and back into the studio as fast as I could.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
This be it?
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
No, haven't heard of it.
Ready for another?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Why should it?
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
Told ya I would. You still riled?
You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
Set one up.
Whattaya do there?
What happened on the charges?
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
I'm sorry.
It has its moments of uncertainty.
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
You ain't actin', mama.
Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin' her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
She got me an abortion...
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
What kinda trash talk is that?
Got anyplace special in mind?
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
You certain?
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
Where?
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
You're scarin' me, baby.
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
You upset with me?
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
They have, sugar.
If you say so.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
No radio or TV...
You sick?
Come sit by me.
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Take care of him?
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Shoot him.
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Yes.
Yes.
Someone's gonna see us.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
What?...
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
I didn't see nothin'...
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
Left you...? Who? Emily?
Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do.
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Don't touch it.
Call it a hunch.
He was never able to reproduce them.
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
And your wife left you.
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
Relax, Vernon...
'Fraid so.
Sure.
Stop calling me Vernon.
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
It's very convincing.
It's colder in there.
I'll miss my bus.
Like the lady herself.
You?
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Can I ask you something about her?
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
What'd you tell him?
Washed up?
Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
So where have you been staying?
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
That's right. That one.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
What?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
Thanks for the halo, James, but I've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever.
Because of my coat?
When?
Near Carvel?
I'm a little worried, James.
Do?
I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Jesus.
But where? I need the street.
It beats 'What's your major?'
Chancellor.
She's left before...
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
Caps.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
I'm kidding. Hello?
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
Really, Sara, I...
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
And what do you think you might have said?
I lost it all.
Some times...
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
Tony. Now that I'm home.
Oh?
I'm in love with your wife.
I was thinking of you.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
I like the noise.
I'm working on it.
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
Ah, come on.
C'mon, Walter.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
Birds.
It's just a city park.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Were you watching me?
I'm not pretty.
Why don't you just tell me?
Woodsman?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
What?
Know what?
I could take you downtown.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
I'd say you're moving.
I count my blessings.
Well, I guess I'll be seeing you.
I'm adjusting okay.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
Will I see you again?
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
No way.
Why not?
I don't understand.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Reflect.
I wish you'd give it a try.
Honest? No.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
You have no feelings for your niece?
I mean, when will I be normal.
We have a lot of work to do.
I want to be normal!
What did you think would happen?
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
I'm only asking questions.
Yes.
What about them?
They could eat you.
Yeah?
No you're not.
The morning?
Well, Walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck.
I molested little girls.
Sounds like a special guy.
Why young girls, Walter?
You must hate your brothers.
I love my brothers.
Maybe you should be.
Who doesn't?
Nothing.
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
Where're you?
How deep's the drop-off here?
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Who else?
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
What do you think he saw?
It's trying to communicate.
You noticed.
Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
Hi, lady.
Who then?
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
God, I hate that bitch.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
You watch yourself.
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
I didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. It lulls you ...
No, Dad, it isn't.
Oh, very well. I'll just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest. I should be used to it by now.
Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
Yes, maybe that is better.
It takes even less.
Who knows why they all left...
Are you joking?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Then why do you say them?
As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...
Why?
Late, very late.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
But then why did you bother changing?
It means being without money.
But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
From Panarea. Why?
Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
But you have to  consider all possibilities, Sandro.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
No.
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
But she watches... she listens.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
I'm not hungry.
Why?
They were stained.
It's not that... it's not that...
What do you mean?
Should you see a doctor?
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
Right now?
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Oh, yes!
Do you think he loves you?
Oh, I know he does.
No. I was sick.
Did it hurt?
And what did you do?
Where did the baby come from?
Agnes, how are babies born?
Are you married?
No.
No.
Why do you smoke?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
I could never be a mother.
A mistake... it was a mistake...
I'm not sick.
How?
She watches... she listens.
... makes me...
That you're a mistake?
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
No I'm not.
And why am I here?
Because I wasn't worthy.
What made it grow?  Do you know?
No.
I'm afraid.
I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
What do you think it's there for?
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
And the passage to the barn?
Him.
Where?
Who?
I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
???
What?
Sister...
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I'll have it.
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
The one up on the third floor?
Unfiltered.
Who was the father?
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
I've already told you what I thought.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
Not simple, no.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
What?
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
I am...
Oh, some time in January.
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
I don't think I care to know.
I'd like yours too.
The woman's health is at stake.
What have we done to hurt you?  And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do?  Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh?  You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?
Fine thanks...
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Hand rolled.
Right...
And Saint John would chew tobacco.
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
I'd like to begin.
Would it stop you if I did?
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
I don't know... too late to stop it.
You went to the room to help with the birth.
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
They are?
Shurrup!
Well --
Y'what?
Yeah.
He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.
Read 'em!
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
Sorry? 
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
Bag-snatcher.
No. I don't.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
I'll have a bash.
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
A butcher?
Ah well. Eh, look!
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
I'll look in here again.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
Are you pulling my leg?
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Is she?
See you.
Parading's better!
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
And what's it all come to in the end?
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
Me!
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
You see, sly villains.
It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
Yeah ... so what?
For Ringo.
That little old man.
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
Oh, I see.
Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
No, not me.
Oh you do, look.
Is it?
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
Sorry.
Do I have to raise me voice?
It's not my fault.
Shurrup, cheerful.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Hell, we're equipped --
Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We haven't even reached the outer rim yet.
What's the terrain down there?
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
Well, get started.
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
-- And the cooling unit on the other.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
And when will you be ready to do that?
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Here, let me try.
The engines are fixed.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
It wouldn't come.
Can you do anything for him?
No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
I'm trying.
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
We can use the flamethrower.
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
Can you see anything?
What is it?
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
We've got about a week left, right?
Let's get moving with this net.
Close...
They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
Well, it's finally happened.
Good!  Moisture content?
Any microorganisms?
Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
Martin, this is an order!  Open the door!
What did it do to you?
Kill me...
Do you wanna head back and call it in?
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Is it dead?
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
Okay, give me the numbers.
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
I dunno.
That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
Yeah, I...
How tight are these shafts?
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
Compensate!
Well... try the headset.
And before that?
Real man' drink.
Want some?
Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
We won't disturb her rest. It seems she left her award in the taxicab. Will you give it to her?
Yes. I do.
Eddie what?
You take charge.
Just some coffee.
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
Just like that.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
Why not?
You sat and talked until it was light...
She never proved anything, not a thing!
No-no-no...
Margo? Lunching in public?
She may be later than you think...
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
In time she'll be what you are.
Right here. A minute ago.
That's nice.
Show me a human and I might have!
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
I'll check with Eve...
I thought you were going to be late-
I had no idea you were even here.
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
Who?
Gone.
I mix what I like.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with the rest of it...
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
The names I've been called. But never Svengali.  Good luck.
You're quite a girl.
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
No thanks, Birdie.
Miss Coonan...
Well?
She's got two things to do - carry clothes an' press 'em wrong - an' just let anybody else muscle in...
An answer.
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
You were just looking around...
What report? To whom?
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
I won't forget.
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
I'll never get over it.
I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
No trouble at all.
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
Harrington.
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
Loud.
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
That was way back...
I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
How do you mean?
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!
Thank you, Lloyd. Godspeed.
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
I placed...?
Would you?
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--mine's better--
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
Sure.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
You want me to be the bastard.
We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
How high up, which Republicans?
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
--we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the way--that fifth man was Haldeman.
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
Morning or night?
Whatever.
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
You can't.
I know where Dwight works.
When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
Chapin did contact you then?
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
--that was awhile ago--
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
How senior?
So?
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
Yes, sir.
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Mitchell knew then.
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
--yes, yes, what is it?
I couldn't say.
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
Don't know; who the hell's Howard Hunt?  It's probably nothing but check it out. Just go easy, it could be crazy Cubans.
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
Could develop.
I know, I did, but damnit Howard--  For the first time since I've known him, I think he's really humping...
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
Badly.  You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
The what to what?
I'm not Miss Abbott.
-- Thanks, coach --
...okay...
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
Yep.
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
You talked to Stifler?
Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar.  If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.
Onions?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
You think she was serious?
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
You're not...busy?
Yes dad.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Yes.  Seriously.
Highly, highly overrated.
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Me?
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
Shame on you!
Can't what?  Do you not want to be with me?  I wish to be entertained, James.
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
God dammit, Stifler!
Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
Just a second!
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
I don't know.  How do you?
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
No shit.
Uh huh.
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
Are you okay?
It's making me hungry.
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate.
Because Gaston was after it.
That's McDermott, but yeah.
Andy, it's not so easy. There are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under Paris. It's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... It's no man's land.
Why would he pick this one?
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
I told you. These murders are not normal.
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
You fucking liar!
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
Poor Meetoo!
Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
Don't be
No! Well, yes, but
No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
And this is my future. This is who I am!
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
Ah! Let us begin!
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
This guy's on television.
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
Lyndon Johnson?
Oh, my God!  She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
How can you possibly oversleep?
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
I'll getcha a piece.
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
I'll see yuh.
M'hm...
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
it's my first time.
H'm?
Here, you want some?
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
What? What?
H'm?
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
And blind people, crippled...
Yeah.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
Yes, it is.
Well, have you ever made love high?
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
Yeah.
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
M'hm.
Yeah?
Whatta you mean? Me?
Oh.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
What?
Oh, I had the radio on.
Yeah?
Holy cow!
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine. My God! What would they think?
Oswald and ghosts.
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
You have a raccoon?
Yeah, were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Just give me the license, please.
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Forget it, Max.
I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left. Right?
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Oh, Jesus.
You wanna lie down?
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
I look pretty.
Oh, yes, yes.
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
I just have time to get the, uh-
And we could just sit and talk... nothing. Uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just be very mellow.
I really enjoyed it.  Nice to have metcha. Good night.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
There's a whole wing in this house.
A long time.
Was it a contractor?
You're fucking desperate.
Like you didn't know.  Who invited the bimbo?
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
October-ish.
It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
Why didn't you bring him?
He's allergic.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Don't you miss it?
You should have brought him.
Fuck you.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
Monica.
We live next door.
Nice to meet you.
Oh yeah?
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
It was fifteen seconds.
I don't think so.
Anytime, sport.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
They're paying him scale.
There's still time to undo this.
Whatever you say.
Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
No.  I missed that.
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
You can never be too early or too thin.
It's ecstasy, Sal.
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
It's not like this all the time.
Anyone else?
You're not ready.
Yes.
Me too.
Oh, you know, I am.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Joking.
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Oh.
Lemon.
A lot of cakes.
Sorry?
I'm so sorry.
Time!
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan.  But I think you're really nice people...
All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan.  They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.
I so wish I'd known.
No, no thanks.
Oh?
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
If he were still alive, maybe.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
Absolutely.  You always wonder where your books end up.  Why don't we use it?
I hope they're watercolors!
A notch above the storage room.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
Big time.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
Wait!  When can I see you again?
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
And only you can become a Queen?
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
...Not enough food?
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
Alright, let's move out!
Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
Ma'am?
So what are you waiting for -- a singing commercial?
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
I should have stayed in bed last night.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
Fine.  Wait.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
What time does the show go on?
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
You shouldn't.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
I thought so.
Why don't we step into any office? There's something I want your advice about, anyway.  I have my own office now, naturally. And you may be interested to know I'm the second youngest executive in the company -- the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
Why?
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
Let me help you.
No -- I don't want anything.
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
What's her first name?
Your stomach?
I am. Let me get the cards.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
Cut.
I'm sure that's the explanation.
What for?
You are?
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Do I have to?
For me?
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
In the knee?
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
I guess so.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
Yes, sir.
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
Sir?
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Not that I have anything to hide.
Sir?
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
What?
You left your wife?
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
What does he mean, accident?
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
Yes, sir.  They are indeed. 
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
You threatening me?
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
Kubelik -- with two k's.
Sure, Doc.
What's this -- you packing?
Well, you can't win 'em all.
No.
No.
The party's over.
My shoes.
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
What gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.
Get more coffee.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
Let me take that.
That's right.
It's been hell.
I don't believe you.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
That's enough, Fran.
You're not being funny.
Okay. I'm sorry.
You know I do.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
You'll miss your train, Jeff.
What gives?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
Where are you headed?
Now just a second -- I'm doing you a favor, buddy -- what're you trying to pull?
Which part is that ?
Delta ?
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
Looks that way.
Who's he?
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
You got to kill this sonuvabitch -- Lance and me, we don''t understand none of this -- Jesus, Captain -- I don't wanna die here -- Do it quick.
Where ?
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point.
Thta's not Charlie's work --
Yeah -- like keep out --
Too far inland.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Would he remember you ?
Do me a favor buddy, please.
NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault.
Yeah.
No, sir.
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
I said it's a good swell -- hell of a good swell 'bout six feet. Let's get a look at it.
What?
Wh -- what?
Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.
I got bored in Saigon.
Can you trust them?
Who knows.
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares the hell out of the slopes -- the boys love it.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
I love it.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
Which one's the Colonel's?
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
Why?
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
No. Not really.
Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
107  CONTINUED:
Keep back.
Six months.
Can't be.  Too keen a sense of this place in your pictures.
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
That's not what I meant.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
Yeah.  Maybe so.
Send him down to her.  There's money in my duffel bag, back at his cabin.
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
That makes the flight more interesting.
You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on.
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
Where's my ELT?
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
No way they'll find you on a five-minute signal.  And no way -more-
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
Let's get out of here.
I got it from here.  Thanks.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
Hang on...  Remember that Cessna we saw at the pumping station on the Haul Road?  Belongs to the guy they got patrolling the pipeline.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Spence.
Oh, please...
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
What you did changed my life.
Lovely.
You take off when you have to.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
Okay. Good-bye.
What do you want?
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
Just let me talk.  I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
You think you're kidding.
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
Yes.  No.
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
Last word freak.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that.
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Okay, then.
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
What are you talking about?
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
Picking on me won't help.
Please!! NO!!!
No.  No I'm not.
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
Yeah.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
How long have you been freelance?
All right, Bain.  Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
Why don't you tell me.
Bain!
You're too late.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
Another contractor.
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
Electra.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
How did you get into the business?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
More or less.
They recruited me when I was in high school.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
No.  Just the first one.
Did it ever bother James Bond?
Nothing.
Work.  The things I need to get done.
No.
What happens if you do?
That sounds nice.
Here?
In Costa Blanca.
How was the beach?
Transmits and receives.
Fine.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
What?
I told you, he will.
I was.
I don't believe that.
Ten years ago.
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
Yes.  Here I am again.
Jesus, if someone had --
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
I know.  It makes me crazy.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
I'm sure you will.
Are you attracted to me?
Why?  I don't know.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
Is this becoming complicated?
When did it start?
That doesn't sound normal.
I think you're supposed to answer that question.
Do you believe that?
Yes.
A dime.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
Wanker more like, what does he know about writing.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
Because it's in English?
And not even then sometimes.
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
What did the beer cost?
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
I thought that was part of the charm!
A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
Yep, except a name for this place.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
No, for the Asylum.
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
Huh?
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
Now you're using that word.
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Do you want me to see what's on them?
I'm not hungry, really.
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
Doug?
You mean your NOT going to spring me?
So am I.
That's my mum's.
Here's the details.
I'll take a rain-check for now.
Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
I hope so!
Not this time, Kat.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
Will this thing take long?
Well she sure isn't normal.
That's not what you said last night. And, I didn't bring that "prick" Josh.
What's the Bugler?
Yeah, but it was okay.
It's Josh's.
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
How do I know this isn't a trap?
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
Come on, that shit can wait.
No way, he even gave me back pay.
Maybe it is!
Well come on, sit down.
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
You are quite sure it's secure?
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
Heart be still.
Why not?
Cuz nothing happened at school.
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
No. I won't be long.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
You do --
Go for it.
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
You think so.
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
It means you can do anything.
No.  But are you -- impressed?
Why not?
I'm not allowed to date.
I have to get you home by one.
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
What would you do up here?
Mars.
No. Why? Are you seducible?
Me.
I'm sick.
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
I thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.
I have expectations, too.
Your parents are divorced?
In there.
I'm no dummy.
When do I get time for me?
I've seen students with records like yours go to J.C. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college.
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
Okay. Make me an isosceles.
What do you want, Biff?
Where's your old man?
Third time they've been out there this week.
Poly-what?
Have we ever met before?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Run out of gas?
What year?
Pro! Release the rope!
Of course! The power converter! It works! Of course, it works...  What chemicals do we use?
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
You don't mind?
Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
Doing what?
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Something mi trabajo.
Yeah?
I got him in the stomach.
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
I don't blame him.
It was going too fast.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Just gimme a chance.
Git.
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
Same one you had yesterday?
Vanished. Thin air.
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
Go away.  Let me rot?
Which?  The one in my throat.
She was killed, Penny.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
A what?
Damn John Whorfin--!
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.
Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll sleep for a while now. What is it you have to do, exactly?
Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect.  Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild.  The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
Barton!
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
Chet! From downstairs!
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
I  I've got respect for  for working guys, like you 
All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
What's that?
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected 
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
Take my copy. You're the toast of Broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash  strike that, a lot of cash.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
Yes... Isn't it?
All right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say?
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game  door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Pictures! Jesus!
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life  why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
And I could tell you some stories 
Nope.
That's all right, really 
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
Where there's life there's hope.
No... Can I come in?
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
I've gotta call the police  or you could call for me 
What do you think happened?
But I didn't do it  don't you believe me?
You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
...Both maybe?
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings  well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town  but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things  if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool  unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was  well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
The others are being sent.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
...Fred...
"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".
Home. Watching TV.
When did you start drinking again?
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
No.
No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
Who?
Sometimes I really hate you.
Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
I know who you are.
Did you leave the club with him?
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
You can make a mistake.
What if I call you Nicky?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
I found Lisa Henderson.
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Do you remember his name?
Nilsen?
I came in here to jack off the damn machine.  One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein.  Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what?  He was her counselor.
Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
I feel fine!
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
You got goddamn tweety-birds flutterin' around your head, that's what you got.  You think you're gonna fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after?  Oh, man.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
Is he dead?
Fuck you, too Nick.
Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
On what basis?
It's yours.
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
Do you ever get sick of it?
Ten bucks apiece.
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
You should talk to him about this.
You want a drink?
I'm here.
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
You're not?
Not what?
What's wrong with you today?
Willie Mays.
Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny.  "Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me." I did say chicken!
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
So then what?
He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like you do it! Your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere. It's good. What else do you want?
Come on, let's get out of here.
Drugs??!
I think I could do that alone.
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
You're your own baby.
How is he?
Would you check out my studio some time?
Have a Mac.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
Can you put me in the ring with him?
I'll make you another one.
I just can't sleep at night. Exploding department stores keep me up.  One ...
I tried to grab you -- save you --
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Treat to be here.
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
Had one.  Didn't work.
And the truth frightened her?
No hard feelings?
Weird, huh?
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
Dad!  Save yourself!
All is shrill, all is blight...
My lips are sealed.
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
What seems to be the problem?
It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
You are going back to school.
You'd be surprised.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Be ready for anything.
I didn't kill your wife.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
I can make it.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
Well...um...her.
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
How about dangerous curves?
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Hardly a worry, sir.
Apology hastily retracted.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
Perhaps the fall...
There's one other thing. I feel..
Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Big house. How many rooms?
And you are?
Why's that?
I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
My life's an open book. You read?
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
Wait. You can't go.
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
Banzai.
Just ones this beautiful.
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
Excuse me.
And into a black dress.
What? This isn't normal?
They've changed. The dreams, I mean. There's a new element I don't understand. A book. Black. Covered in leather....
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
I don't-.
Excuse me.
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please.
...The Box can change their lives.  Our stock coupons will spike.
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have...  ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Odd desire for anyone.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
... We could try that.
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
Hang on. I have to leave a message.
Take 'em! I want his head!
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
About how pretty you are, pretty boy.  Maybe he'd like to know --
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
I said I'd check with you.
About Charles...
No, I'm fine.
Howls he getting on with the family?
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love you. .  Jesus - what a terrible tie- Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a little surprise for you and the Boss.
David?
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
But is she gonna be okay?
I am sorry you feel that way.
This sucks.
Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Me first!
Cool! Huh huh huh.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Heh hmm heh heh.
Uh... I think you scared them off.
Huh? Huh huh.
Okay. I'll go right after you.
Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
Dill-wad...
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
Oh, that's nice.
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father. 
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Yup. Huh huh.
Hey, you wanna see something really cool? Huh huh huh.
Oh... I'm sorry...
I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.
Two hours.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
You know you're really a pretty girl.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.
Who did the sushi?
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
Really.  I don't know.
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
... I will.
He's your cousin.
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
Otho'll know what to do.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
Delia will cook...
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
Maybe Charles does.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
... Straight out?
Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
No.
Yes, I will.
Yes, Robert. I will.
Oh, really?
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
No, Eve... I'm sorry.
He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
That's good.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Hello, Eve.
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until...
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
Yes, I understand.
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
Yes.
Yes.
No.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
I'm going to work in the garden.
Yes.
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
I was given meals, and a home...
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
... Hello.
Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
... Spring and summer...  Yes, I see... Fall and winter.  Yes, indeed...  Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
Do you feel well enough for that?
That's good... That's good.
Good evening, Wilson.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
No! He's a real gardener!
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
No, sir.
So...? Where the hell is it?
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
Thank you, Colonel.
Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
It's that serious, huh?
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
You take care too, Bobby.
Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please say no!
She's very beautiful.
I was worried.
The ferret?
Right.
What?
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
What's that?
Fuck Maxine.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
I know.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Pardon?
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
I wouldn't know.
Who told you?
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
My God.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
Impressions? Those are hard.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
The Great Mantini?
Do tell. I love a good plan.
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Says who?
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
Yes, Hi.
After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
I have to see you.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
You mean with Malkovich?
Really? Yeah. Okay.
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
That's the last thing they took from me.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YES.
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Be here. In case.
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
I know what I see.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
Aw, no, Ella.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
No use thinking these things now.
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
I don't want to know.
Leave off..
You got to get up from here, girl.
She was my best thing.
What? What? You talking back to me?
Yeah. Too sweet. 
Uh?
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
Her life is in your hands.
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
That is our most modestly priced receptacle.
That's fucking exactly what happened, Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
I'm shomer shabbas.
No--
I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
Yes, uh, very impressive.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
Separate incidents?
But she hasn't run off, she's been--
Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Jeffrey Lebowski.
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Oh, no.
Well--sure, I could do that--
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
Finder's fee?
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
Theodore Herzel.
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
No, you're not wrong--
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
Just for making the hand-off?
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's the bridge--
Walter, please--
Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't see, um-- what exactly is the problem?
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
Thanks Walter.
That makes me feel all warm inside.
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?
Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
Yeah.
That's fuckin' combat.  The man in the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy fuckin' adversary.
Then what's...
Okay, listen--
Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.
You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
Did I urinate on your rug?
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
Help me put him back in his chair.
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
We'll take 'em in the morning.
He's half yours, partner.
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
What about Nomak?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Like cancer with a purpose.
Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --
Sounds like a plan.
What do you really think?
I don't like it.
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
You're wrong.
"The Blood Tide".
For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.
How can you tell?
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Like what?
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
I know. Take some of my blood.
Then what is it?
Why should I respect something which has outlived its purpose?
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
We weren't sure we could trust you.
I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
What happened to her, where did she go?
Bullshit! Talk!
Trying to find the energy.
Inside the grave?
--a six week bun in the oven--
Who?
Then there she blows.
The Witch's voice.
So whoever built this--
I haven't killed any--
--Nick!!
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
You said the name "James."
Sleep.
--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
Why?
I know, I know.
Yeah.
The, uh, blur there.
I don't know yet.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
That's what Josh and Mike said.
No.
Try a long walk.
Just go.
Hey, hon'--this is what pays the rent and tuition.
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
No idea--goddamitt!
--things got a way of finding <u>you</u> here.
Yeah. Me too.
What?
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
<u>What</u>?
--and we brought it back with us!
Okay.
What'd you say?
Okay. Hypothetically.
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
You're needed here--keep watching--
Anna--
Does she, goddamnit??
Not that I've seen--but that has no meaning--that means nothing.
--it's urgent!
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
--thank you for calling--
Sort of...
...Huh?
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
...You ever get tired?
Abby--
All right...
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
No.
You owe me for two weeks.
For the money.
...What?
Ya catch any fish?
Ya catch any fish?
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
How would I know?
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Anything you can tell me?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Yes sir.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
I wanted to see you.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Sure I'm alright. 
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Don't say that.
Yeah. hurry up though.
Who's it, you mean.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
I want you to hurt me.
Frank would open you.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
My secret lover.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
No thanks. what does that mean?
Go where?
On a ride.
Nothing.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
Where are they?
Yeah. Good bye.
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Alright.
Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yes. I do.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Okay. yeah, call.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You saw a lot in one night.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
No.
Just some fatherly advice.
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
It's okay.
No.
Dorothy Vallens?
... Sandy?.
Hey Jeff.
Are you feeling okay?
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
This is it.
Be right down.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Alright.
Nothing. I'm fine.
Well.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
Where do you guys want to count?
Motherfucker works fast.
This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the bar.  And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight.
Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
Excuse me?
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
No.
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
Barbara and me.  No one else.
Yeah.  She told me.
What's that?
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
No more brothers, Diego.
Coke.
Diego?
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
I'm going to California.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
Tuna.
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
Put that shit away, they're here.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
I said, I've seen it before.
Out.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
How are you doing?
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
It's alright, Dad.
Shhhh.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Okay, George.
Who's the co-pilot?
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
Exactly.
Sure. By shooting at me.
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
Of course. As soon as possible.
Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do?
No, and neither were my men.
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
I'm trying.
No -- but I got something.
Not sure.  I'll have everything you need tomorrow.
Then how did it get into his body?
Yes.
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.  Your witness.
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
No.  Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions. She doesn't have to sit here and be insulted.  So, either you charge her now or we're leaving.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Rebecca Lawson.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Yes.
Yeah.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
She was here?
Show me.
About a year and half ago.
Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.
How long were you together?
I had a bad heart.
I had bypass surgery.
And how are you now?
Thank you.  The State rests.
Did you ever see her again after that?
Cocaine.
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
If necessary I can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence.
No.
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
No.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
Yes.
Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
Tastes can change.
Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
You and me -- making love.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
It's not that long.
Oh Jesus.
Why are there two deeds here?
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
No. We're going to lock this up and --
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
Oh, yes.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Oh, that'll be nice.
Francesca. Robert.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
Why, do you think?
Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.  Did you love teaching?
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
No. I'm all right. It's working.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
... I feel like something's been spoiled now.
Yes! Hi.
I would love to come for dinner.
Yeah. See you later.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Are you hungry?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Have you ever been to that station?
I sat there once. It was hot. Like today. I'd been shopping. I had all these bags around my feet I kept having to move every time the waiter came by...
Because I already tried once.
Yes, thanks.
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Later. Go back to sleep.
It's only four days.
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Damned if I know.
Just try it.
I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
But.
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
We met.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
You know I can't.
I have to finish this for class.
Have you ever been inside?
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
You moved into this block?
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
Anytime.  Be seeing you.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
Bill!  Bill?!
I can't find you.
Back here.  At the end of the block.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
I didn't sell it.
Shit, that was fast.
But --
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
It was just like in my head.
You haven't?
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
Save him?  What are you talking about?
You want to get into this now?
All right!  Where's the key?
Where is it?
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
Yeah, I know.
You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You understand?
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
Where, then?
We're going to need some time.
Shut up, Violet!
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Everything you couldn't.
Good idea.
I should be going.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Are you okay, Violet?
Sure, Mickey.  Sure.
Caesar, you still got the money?
Fuck it, I don't need the key.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Caesar is your husband?
He's a launderer?
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
Nothing.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
Work.
What about that guy this morning?
Mickey?
If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
How much money?
He hung it up.
Why?
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Yeah, twice.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Any bodyguards?
I won't.
okay, all right.
I'm here, aren't I?
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
Forget it.
I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
Yes.
We have to go home, Jason.
MPG Capital.
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
You are a friend of his?
I think not...  No, I'm sorry.  It was very sudden. He was here very briefly.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
Then I'll find another ride.
I know that.
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
No.
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
I thought about it.  I don't know.
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
Anytime.
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
Go back to the hotel.
xxxxxx
We have to keep moving.
xxxxxx
What about you?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
My husband's out looking for him.
xxxxxx
-- I'm on it --
Abbott wants to talk.
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
You we're lost at sea.  They pulled you out.  Who are you?  You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back.  You understand me?  Who are you?
I don't know.
Thank you.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Me? - if I'm worried about anyone, it's you. What happened to you, Sam? You were the brightest of us -
Yes, thanks.
How do you mean?
So how ...?
What has Tuttle done?
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
And you're mine.
You're the only person I can trust.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
I do. Goodbye. 
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Bastard!!!
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Where do I get it stamped?
Oh.
Don't look back! Act naturally!
No.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
It does doesn't it?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
A heavy Christmas present.
Suit me?
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Are you still following me?
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
Where are you going?
Information Retrieval.
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
What a BITCH!
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
27156789/074328/K.
What?
Can I forget it?
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.
I won't be held responsible.
There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
It's something for executives.
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
I ... uh ...
Numero deux, duck a l'orange. 
What? Who is this?
No, sir.
Central Services.
It's a 27B/6 of course.
Ha!!
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
The pace?
Can you fix it?
I've never fired anyone in my life.
You can trust me on this one.
Mary, we really have to go.
I can't hold up my head anymore.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
Yes.
He's working a double shift.
I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
How long you been doing this?
Don't seem so bad to me.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here. 
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
Crazy fucker.
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
It's early for him.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
You're burned out.
It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
Yeah, you're right.
Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
You really think so?
Nice, Jane.
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
No?
I'll see you back at the hotel.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
Why?
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it, Ellen.  Let's call security and get him out.
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Of course.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Good.
As good as humanly possible.
Aaron, will you tell me?
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
How?
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
You didn't say anything to her?
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you.
Yes.
No, I don't think so.
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
That's okay.
Honey?...
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
Nooo.  If I could just have a roll, I'd be okay.
Yes, sure.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
Uh-huh.
I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it.
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
What do you mean clean?
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Excited.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Me!
Uh-huh.
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
I knew what you meant.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
You want to come?
Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
Yes, I'm sorry.
Shh!
Oh it's enough...
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
Righto.
Here here...
Yes Walter.
I know.  But I wanted to talk to you.
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Just about anything, Walter.
What?
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
Don't ask.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
I know, man.
Now what kind of statue was that?
Well do some looking around the room. I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...
Sure!
A parakeet?
Yeah, why?
It was.
Well invite the critics, and the art collectors...we'll tell them...
Excuse me I have to make a call...
No...look I'm busy...
Did you see my cat?
Yeah I did.
Huh?!!!
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
"Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Yes, get rid of them...
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
Good morning Walter!
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
What's with you?
Wrong answer!  No prize.
We're looking at a dog, possible coffee...
You think?  Split?
I'm fine.
I'm hungry.
Probably.  What movie is this?
What's Bobby gonna say?
I do?  I guess I do.
So I noticed.
I think you've forgotten something.
Buffy.
You want some water or something?
Well, stay here tonight.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
'Just remember you're in training, son'
I forgot.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
What are you talking about?
Wait!
Time to do what?
Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Oh, him.
What?
We'll cover it later.
They were vampires?
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
And it makes it worse when I die, right?
I can't work this.
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
All right.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
So very much.
Oh, baby!
I heard she got straight A's.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Well, I hope so.
Does Jeffrey know?
Wit-tay.
Right!
Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
You can learn to like it.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?
Nuke?!
I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
I won't be needing these anymore.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
I'm not interested yet.
Yep.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
You're pulling your hips out.
Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
No.
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
Annie---
You got a live arm there.
You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
You missed the tag!
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
I won't have to.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
C ' mon!
No.
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
You can do anything you want.  Hop in.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Eight and sixteen?!  How'd we ever win eight?  Jose, what's this sign?
Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.
Liar.
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
The worst was Blue.
Wait, hold on a second.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
702 472 1862.
Well...
They payin'?
You mean, I have your permission?
And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
All right, Ace?
Okay.
Why, somebody's complaining?
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
Hey.
Just say so.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
Yes, you lost your control.
...to me.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
And what'd she want?
I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
Yeah, refill'd be great.
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
It's always been our policy -
Nice to see you, Senator.
Why not make them happy?
Here we go. Good luck.
What is it?
The little guy. He's half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint, so we...
Oh, no.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
Yeah. Yeah.
You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
Oh, fabulous.
You can trust me.
Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
Okay.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
...under?
And...
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
With what?
He needed some clothes.
There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
You threw it away?
I was with somebody.
I can back him off.
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
Oh...
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
You get down here!
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
That's amazing.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
No.
No, Sir.
Can you do it with your left hand?
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
Hi. Good.
Jeff, would you go in with her?
I can't.
Okay.
Now move along.
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
Is that the last one?
Fuckers!
Carmine's gone.
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
Of course, Remo.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
Hi, how are you?
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
Okay.
Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy.
Nothin'.
Let me think about that.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Is that what you want?
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's what you want?
Get lost?
I'm here.
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
I'm always here for you.
You do?
She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
Listen...
You know why, right?
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
It's up to you.
Let's get out of here.
I know. I know.
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Angelo and Buster.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
No more! You see? Watch!
How you doin'?
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
I know, but that's enough.
Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
I suppose she does.
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Priceless...We have a showdown in this alley, right?
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
Winning.
Well. I stand corrected.
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
Kelly, get to work on those new uniforms.  I'm not running a summer camp here..
How much?
You're scaring me, Selina.  Do it some more.
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
Okay, deal.
"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
I don't see anybody in there but you.
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
Or relieve me of it later.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
What am I supposed to do?
Give me 20 minutes at least.
You don't understand.
You're the one who's not to be believed.
I can't stay on this line.  I'm picking people up.  I'm already overdue.  Hello? 
What do they need her for?
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
What about the others?
Sometimes I paint.
A price on everything.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
I've got to ask somebody.
The one in Brentwood.
What bank?
The City National on San Vincente.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
Why tell me this?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
What did you do?
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
Can you walk?
Why can't it be her?
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Shit.  You couldn't be in much worse shape.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
A typical fuck-up.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
Ask them.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
What's your point?
That's not good enough.
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
I won't let 'em.
Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?
Seems not.
Who are you?
Very official.  259-7881, if I recall.
Undercover.
Well, you get to say, The usual, Col. Things like that.
So who's he?
Stop it, Dil --
Fucking mad!
You can't leave me then, can you?
No, I didn't --
What look?
Whiskey.
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Told you, I'm superstitious.
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
So I'm sorry.
Make it up to me, then.
When?
All right, they do.
I'm working on it.
Please, Jimmy.
Should have stayed a girl.
Not at all, honey.
She from Scotland too?
I'm not sure.
Do you like me even a little bit?
Anything.
For you...
I will be.
Died...
Don't you want to kill me?
Never.
Fergus.
What happened to Jimmy?
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
Tell me what she wore.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
Did you give him it?
Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.
No, what is the thing?
So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
Some judge...
So?
Thanks.
You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep.
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
Right.
So it's on the street.
Can't.
Am I?
I can smell her perfume.
No?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
Not in your nature.
What do you know about my nature?
What?
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
Best game in the world.
The fastest.
Toffs' game there. But not at home.     .
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.
Doesn't matter where.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Want you to do something, Fergus.
What?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
Well -- come on.
Open up.
I love you, Adam.
Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
Don't be an idiot!
Then who did? You're the only one left.
Here, give it to me.
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
I heard you, I heard you.
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
But --
That's not Carson Dyle.
Steal it how?
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
That's the spirit.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
Brian.
No.
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
You'll wreck your raincoat.
Okay -- up there.
Open it.
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Your --
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
Why can't you be serious?
Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
Oh. 
That sounds like their problem.
I'll be right there.
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
I don't think I know that one.
How often do you go through this little ritual?
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
Well!
Go on.
What do you mean?
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Yes.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
Meaning what?
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
What do you want?
I don't know.
Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.
And this?
No -- in my room.
Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where?
I'm not sure I --
Oh. I guess.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Now you're angry.
Are you in the book?
I'm still having trouble with English.
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!
Because I don't love him.
Don't you want me to stay?
At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
What's the matter, chrie?
We will separate -- you look over there.
We want that money -- now!
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
Good.
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
That's impossible.
Daddy you scared me!
I'm not.
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
It can't be.
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
No. I'll handle this.
You know where I can find her?
I can.
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
What are you doing here?
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
Mark Shale.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
What?
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
No.
I'm fine.
I heard you got attacked.
I did.
I do not.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
Yeah.
That's not why we broke up.
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
Mom?
I need to ask you something.
Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
Why not?
The principal?
Kenny's aunt?
Hi Sandy.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
No.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT.
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Oh...
Where's Sam?

...moron.
Oh.
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
And if that Elvis shit...
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
Shut...
 Excuse me...
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
Do you wanna give me a minute?
Yeah, borrowed!
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...

Okay.
...I'm not the psycho.
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
...let live.
Well, then, that means it's call...
...waiting!
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--

...do we?
Oh, shit.
God, man!
Come on.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.

...man!
He's crazy!

Okay.  Okay.
Oh, no!



Whoo-hoo-hoo!
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
We were nationally  ranked.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
...split.
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
That is loud!  I'm 
Are you all right?

Huh?
We're gonna die!





Come here.
Okay.  Okay.
Oh, shit.
What the--?
...-ta get outta here!


Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!


Ooh.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
It's for you.
Three seconds.  One...
...such is the price...of patriotism.
Vaughn.
I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
Alert seventy-fifth rangers.  Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building.
...-lar.
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
Now listen to me.
No!

You'll kill us all!
Is this stool taken?
Went away? 
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
Vaughn, Burke, move to the end of the street.  Fan out and work your way back to the motel.
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
Check the immediate area.
...quick in and out.
No.  A pair of average citizens have decided to risk their lives for their country.  I almost remember what that feels like.
Right.  Tim Mason.
...general store.
Richard Long.
It's a hundred degrees...
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
...time to time, yeah.
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
...to die for a country that's...
I got someone who's anxious to talk to you, Mr. Mason.


 ...checked. 




...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
...like April.  It gives him gas. And make sure there's  two pots of coffee...
Uh, we both like to fish.
His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue.  But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.
...now!
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
Uh-huh.
I will tell you what I...
A man named Tim Ma-...
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.

...is death.
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
I didn't sell the boy any...
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
I'll lead 'em out.
 


INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
An honest living.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
No. She's probably scared to death.
My daughter.
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Ain't worth thinking about.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.
No thanks.
Curly, where's your car?
Where's that?
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Oh yes.
No?
You accusing me of extortion?
Absolutely.
And why's that?
C'mon I'll show you.
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Gittes, stay outta this.
Of course.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
Iced tea.
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
It wasn't much of a lie.
My husband.
He told you?
Did you have affairs?
You mean you don't know where you were?
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
Then it was over the water department.
Oh, yeah?
The Valley?
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
Is that unusual?
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
When was the last time?
Working for the District Attorney.
You can't always tell what's going on there.
Could you do anything about it?
And I want to know where.
It has to do with my father.
I saw him.
Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
Aren't you coming back with me?
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
No...
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
Katherine.
On his day off. Get the exact address.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
What about the water?
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
I'm afraid so.
But I have to know.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Yes. No.
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Then why don't you change jobs? 
Too bad!
Why? What do you mean?
It was probably meant to be like this. Each of us has a star to follow. So now what are you thinking of doing?
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Bye-bye, Elena.  ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
You never used to do that!
Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...
I didn't see that.
Look at that.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
Enthusiastic?
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher!
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
Charlie?!
You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane.  That's all -
Sure.  They're like anybody else. They got work to do.  They do it.  Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
Probably.  There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
Of course.
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
Hmm!
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
Oh, me -
I didn't say.
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
Lock it - and keep it locked.
Not my wife - not either of them.
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
It's been a tough day.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
What?
I've got to think of Emily -
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
She's going to leave you -
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
What check?
Oh, yes, the bonus.
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday.  I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane. She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest esteem -
Was he in love?
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.  Go after the people that knew Kane well.  That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts -  I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -
Millions - if anybody wants it.
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
Get out of here!  Get out!  Get out!
What did you get?
He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother?  You don't believe me, but it's true.  It just happens to be true.  He was really interested in my voice.  What are you smiling for?  What do you think he built that opera house for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't want to sing.  It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him.
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
Am I sure?
How long have you been smoking?
I'll just take the gum.
Do you mind if I drink this here?
How long have you been a smoker?
Okay. I'm sorry about that.
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
Dick.
He went home to change for the big date.
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
Train. It took eight hours.
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
Was I right?
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
No.
Are you open?
Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
You win.
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fianc.
Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
She's in here?
I told him that and he yelled at me.
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
What kind of show?
Can we talk about this later?
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
I don't back down.
Because you buckled.
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Gatorade.
Exactly. They drank it all.
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
Why not?
You hardly knew her!
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
That's embarrassing?
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
Not yet. 
What?
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
What did she say?
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Could be.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
Leave me alone.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
I don't think so.
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
Nothing personal.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
He died in the bathroom.
We were going to start again, I think.
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
Actually, that's his night job.
I had a friend that used to chew glass for a living. In the circus.
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Jesus... go ahead.
I said go ahead.
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
You're kidding.
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Three?
Three including you.
You've only had sex with three different people?
I'm not the pig you are.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
HOW MANY?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
I love you. Don't feel sick.
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...
Randal...?
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that.
Does he sing in English or Russian?
Feel that.
Now feel his.  Roll up your sleeve, chief.
Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
You hope what feels good?
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Exactly, cheesehead, exactly.
Who's shooting?
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Would you?
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Oh, please.
You couldn't.
Where?
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
He doesn't want my help.
What if he can't?
I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Want me to lead?
Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Helluva time for vanity!
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
I won't do it.  No way.
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
How far?
I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
There.  You blind?
Climb, Gabe, climb!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
Thank you, sir.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Good.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Keeping fit then?
Well, how are you then?
No, brother. What d'you want?
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
Alexander de Large, sir.
No, sir.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Fair hair, sir.
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
No, sir.
Lice?
Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!
We're going to friends now, sir.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Vitamins will it be then?
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
Yeah... Pete the English.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Not a chance, my dear fellow. The Ggovernment can't be concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories. Soon we may be needing all of out prison space for political offenders. Common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis. Kill the criminal reflex that's all. Full implementation in a year's time. Punishment means nothing to them, you can see that... they enjoy their so-called punishment. Alex seizes his chance as they pass by.
No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
There were two of us.  I had the other guy killed.  Don't need the competition...
Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
Max...
Where are you, what floor?
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
You sure?  You look pretty shaky...
Oh, my, yes.
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
...if they're wrong?!
Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
I've been calling and calling.
You're gonna cheer up.
What's he sayin'?
<u>My hands are taped to the fucking </u> <u>steering wheel!</u>
It got crashed!  I didn't...
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
I'm cool.
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
It's not me, it's the engine!  A fat guy fell on it from six floors up!
How long, you figure?
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
You said you were visiting friends!
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies.
So what?
Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna kick your fat ass.
Yes, Max?
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
What, no insurance?
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
You get benefits?
You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
One more.
Let her go.
I live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar.  I saw you kiss.  Admit it, this is the street where love lives.
The guy came right at us!
Look, I'm sorry --
Shut the hell up.
You bit someone's nose off?
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
For what?
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Them who?
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
And look here.  Cease fire in Chechenia.  That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons.  Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado.  Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive.  They've accused the E.P.A. of, quote, 'turning a blind <u>eye</u> to the future.'
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
He was murdered.
You watch me, don't you?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
Henry Finch.  That they monitor everything.  That it was only a matter of time.  And now four people are dead.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
It's Geronimo.  Love. It lets you see things.  It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
You go.  Send me a postcard.
Did you kill him?
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
That's great.  Good for you.
Could you be a little more specific?
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
You've never seen her run.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
Whatever.
A dog bit it.
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
I don't understand.
Working.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
-- Understood.
You don't understand --
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
Wasn't my idea.
Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?
I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.  She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
Now... you go home.
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
A page-break signal.  A period.
-- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission.  Heaven is the mustard seed.
Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her.  And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out.  That's Paris, where my daughter was born.  Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking.  So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang.  As if it never happened.  If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed.
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
That's what they all say.
Sounds like a Russian general.
Yavol.
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
We could be together again --
But what about your research -- ?
You too.
Like it.  Almost there.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
Wait -- hold on a minute --
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
I don't think so.
Why?
I don't follow.
It's late.  We should go back.
Thank you.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
It was quite a page turner.
They don't believe me.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
Git movin', I said.
But I made this arrangement --
I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
You steal a car?
I don't know, Boss.
You don't know!
Git to work!
-- went down to see this old hag and she had needles the size of that cane.
I call.
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
And all the time you was plannin' on runnin' again.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
Do we even get our same bunks back?
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
Gettin' up, Carr.
Cuter.
Call.
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
Andy?
Then, why don't you just die.  I'm going.  They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on.  Make up your mind.  Live or die.  I'll get coffee.
He was lying.
You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
When he was seventeen.
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
What Friday?
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
Who was the man in the basement?
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
Oh, I think you will.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
How do you know that?
He felt remorse.  He covered her.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
Because I'm all you've got.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
Maybe you should...
Well, thanks.
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
He can get into my computer any time he likes!  This is exactly the kind of thing I didn't want to have happen.
Not yet.
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
Will you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid to sleep... I don't want...<u>him</u>...in my head...
Is there a phone booth there?
They all have one...
Over here.
Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
That's always your privilege, sir.
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set...
It's about time.
You should have gone to the funeral.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
I'd like to go back. James...
James.
They said it was here. They told me this morning.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
Really?
Yeah, it'll be fun.
She said she'd be here at 10.
Do you think I should?
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
Ecru.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
But what am I going to do?
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
You've only known Jake a few months.
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
Mom, please.
Yeah?
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
By color.
Who do you think you are?
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
What are the delusions like?
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
No way.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
List schmist. You'll remember.
Really?
I think I should go home.
Coming.
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
Michael, take it easy.
Yeah, the plans.
Well then why'd it happen?
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
I'm calling in sick.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Yes, I suppose so.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
I'm glad you're doing well.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
Oui.
Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
Uh, yeah.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
No thank you.
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
And the other half?
No problem.
Because you're the closest.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
I thought they came with batteries.
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
Some bread and...
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
Man, I can get anything.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
Okay boss.
Go look.
Oh yeah.
I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
Mr. Taylor?
I said a clean break.
I don't know what you're talking about.
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
What?
Where is it, Sophie?
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
You wanna tell him?
Sounds boring.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
Yes.
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
What's it to you?
I'll never live as a thief!
Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple.
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
Long.
Don't bother.
You don't seem to understand.
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
You're a sword fighter too?
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
What do you think?
You're probably right.
How so?
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
Only the sword will settle this.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
Father!
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
Care for a hot dog?
Annie, I need a file.
Don't thank me.
Thanks, babe.
You don't say.
I saw it, too.
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
No.  I have one more thing to do.
Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
No.
Take the dope, too.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all.
Very well, it's your ass.
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Move in, guys.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
The night is young.
You might say that.
I'll be fine.
I know.
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
You talking to me?
Refreshing.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
No thank you.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
You don't even know me.
Doing what?
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
I will.
No?
Good for you.
But you knew this was important to me.
Schwarz. Jewish?
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Outstanding.
No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?
Those are my letters!
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
What are you saying?
Why?
What do you mean?!
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
I want to go home.
Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
But -
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
I do.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
Yummy.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Yes!
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Outstanding.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
What's your plan of attack?
I hate it too.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Where'd she go?
Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
And that's why you're leaving?
It clearly is why.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
Is that what you think?
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Well done.
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
Come again?
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
I've already told you, she's not home.
I need to talk to Annette.
We played backgammon?
You bastard!
I'd love to.
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
At the old house with the voice.
Are they nice?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
She was very pretty.
What's her name?
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
What?
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
We've got to go on.  Amy, here, all this time, you've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours. Now we find you've only kept it secret.
Yes, daddy.
Where did you mail them?
They ran away.
Let me be the judge of that.
Voices from an old dark house!
Whenever you want.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
But she's dead!
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
Soon as I finish.
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days  those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Why hasn't he got a head?
Good.
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
I can't do it! I can't do it!
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
It's not just in my head.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
Why would they exaggerate?
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Give him the tampon test.
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
Okay. I guess so.
It is so hot in here.
I still thought it was a purse.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Did you get rid of Mark?
You should have seen it erect.
So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
About Mark? Carlton?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
They say sex is great for cramps.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
I didn't have to pee then.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Take your shower.
Your desk.
Are you following me?
Oh, it's nothing.
No, she died when I was twelve.
What are they for?
I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.
No, I got it. It's okay.
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
No, but thanks for the warning.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
Worse than this?
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
I know. The important thing is that it stop.
What makes you think I was the last one?
How big?
She's just so... pathetic.
He's been running money for the Mafia.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
We only live a few blocks apart.
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.
Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
I'm afraid so.
Put it through...
Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
So you're telling me the truth <u>this</u> time?  Is that it!
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
What?
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
What the hell is this ?
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
I don't give a shit.
TilT we figure something out.
Is that everybody?
Fine.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
Bob...
I was gonna do something with Joan.
Choices?
Fine.
She knows.
He's not.
Does it make the cars any better?
Fertility beads.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
I don't understand.
Oh... Yeah.
It's just so strange...
I'm starving.   There's got to be something open around here.
It was inspirational.
Yeah... Bedtime.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
Oh, I have no doubt.
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
No, Miss Science. You're the one who needs to do some thinking.
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
No, sir.
I'll tell you later.
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
I'm sorry.  I, we
All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
To put the rout all that was not life.  And not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.  Pledge Overstreet.
Nuwanda, what is going on?
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
No.
It's better than doing nothing.
Chet...
Knox?!
Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Knox!  what are you doing here?
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
Dead Poets honor.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
At these boys' age? Not on your life! Tradition, John.  Discipline.  Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
I don't know.
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
I'm sorry, Neil.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
And no questions asked.
And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
It ain't any better out there!
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
How do you know that?
Keep tasting...
You ain't giving the orders here!
I'm stuck...
For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast.
Like Mamooli's country...
Plans don't change...
What is it man?
Shut up!
There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and...
Fuckin' A!
I'm telling you, they changed it!
Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired.
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
Worse since she talked to who?
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
What hospital is he in? Where?
You are frightened, no?
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
How was huntin'?
Yeah?
Now he's back.
Sit down. Here. Right here.  Albert! Vince!
Biederman!
I will not betray my country. No. Ne-ver!
Oh... You know...
Will you marry me?
Sure.
I made you a sweater.  Here... You have to take that off.
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Oh, it's great. Fine.
I see you're going hunting.
C'mon. I've got the car.
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
We... Three bullets.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
That way it sets.
Yeah.
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
No. No way!
There's Albert!  Hey, Albert!!!
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
I gotta get back, Nick.
Did you get one?
Where?
Phantom Mary?
In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
Wade did a little reminiscing.
What did you say?
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
No, but he's going to be by tomorrow. He's aging.  'Bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty-eight hours.  In that time he'll be an old man.  Could be a year, an hour, or all at once. Called NPA Syndrome.  Natural Pro- gression of Aging.  It affects each individual differently.  I'm sure it's painful.
And I want Doucet.
Remember my promise.
He could be brought back.
What the hell are you talking about?
Well, that's good enough for me.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
What's it mean?
Yeah.
Seat's too high.
This little thing says I can't.
You could always take it off.
Oh --  Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady.  Get some wine for the Squire, Belle.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
And serve him right!
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
She couldn't be gone!
But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
-- in gold.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
Yes, why shouldn't it?
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
Ten throws it is.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
Well, I --
Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
Shall we?
Morning, Jabez.
Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
You really think so?
Well -- yes --
Shake!
If it would only move old Miser Stevens -- We've still got to pay him.
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
Jabez!
Looks right elegant, Mary.
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
Jabez!
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
Wouldn't profit him none.
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
I guess we won't.
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
Pretty good -- that's perfect!
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
So, why didn't you come?
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
Then don't waste time talking to me.
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
Holly Gennero?
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
They boys'll be glad.  We got a pool going on you.
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
Bullshit.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
Yessir.
Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is!
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
Okay.
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
You know, Sonny, I used to dope a lot, and I was into dipping?  And I did a couple bank jobs, and the Lord Jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how?
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
I'm afraid.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
You alone, or you got confederates?
You frisk me.
So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
... armed robbery ...
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
We're bringing in your wife...
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
What if I take you with me?
I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.
They look like good kids.
Special to me, too.
No you don't.
Yeah?
Are you a lawyer?
I told you, he's got diabetes.
It was on the TV.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
I used to, but I stopped.
Because I don't want cancer.
You shouldn't start now.
My body?  What for?
You're serious!
Let's go, Sonny.
What are you crying for?  Jesus Christ.  It's not your fault there's no money...
Dead or alive?


That's all they're interested in - it's a freak show to them.  I can't control it, Sal - let'em say what they want.  Forget it.  It don't matter.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Oh, Jesus!  Hey.  How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board.
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
Okay, when do I get them?
It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
Gimme the black guy...
You can't allow!  I'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Whatta you want?  Two hundred?  A thousand?
Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
I forgot she's in here.
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?
What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.
Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night.
<i>Chinga te y tu mama tambien.</i>
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
<i>What is it?</i>
<i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.
Chi-Chi has gone to doggie heaven, bitch!
Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
No last names. Just Domino. The less you know about me the better, okay?
Hello?
<i>Turned out Edna. had one last trick up her sleeve.</i> <b> INT. FENDER COMPOUND -- KITCHEN -- [FLASHBACK] TEN MINUTES AGO
...THEN SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.
<i>The tough get going.</i>
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
What?
No, you the man.
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
Is it a good morning?
I hope the block is still standing.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
That's it.
What makes Sammy run?
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
I just come home to take a quick shower.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
What responsibilities?
I'm coming.
Yeah, me too.
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
And move to Long Island...
D!  D!  D!  You dumb motherfucker. Learn how to speak English first.  D.
Fuck!  My money!
It's dug.
What?
Negroes kill me, always holdin' onto, talkin' 'bout their dicks.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
I would like to get paid now.
Sal, I want my money.
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
We both do.
No.  What are you gonna do?
Meda.  Meda.
You get paid to do what we say.
Eddie Murphy.
Ya like him, huh?
I'm listening.
That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito.
We don't know nuthin' else.
Tell Pino.
Yeah, I think.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Four colors? Neato!
You and Lloyd chose the class!?
Come over around seven.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
Coming.
I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
Home school. Til today.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
The second R is silent.
Yeah, go-cart accident.
What?
Where did you learn that word?
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?
...cause you said...
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
Just wanted to see how your doing.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
No. What happened?
Hello, he only invented money!
You certainly did.
Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
And with that complete loser
Well, what should we do?
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
No.
I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league.
You're just jealous.
Me too. I'm almost there.
Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here.
Looks like the best man won.
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
Do we have a deal?
You know I do!
Oh yeah, give it to me.
People! Come on. "Parade" float.
Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
Wow, you are smart.
It's a surprise.
This band sounds terrible.
Love it!
Yes?
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders...
Sire!
That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
Not sorry enough.
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
They said you were dead.  They said...
My Lord?
The Emperor's blade.
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
He's hiding something.
That it is.  He shall know your ways as if born to them.
Always?
Why do they come?
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
It is my home.
Oh, tract housing, huh?  I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank.  What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy <u>shower</u>.  I still don't know where to hang the towels!
It's a pleasure...
Really?
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me.
You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian.  Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes.
Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this production.
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
I don't know how to make goulash.
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
Eddie, you screwed up.
But maybe not.
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
What's to protect?  It was perfect!
You <u>can't sit</u>!  You gotta walk around, with good posture.  You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll <u>never</u> invest in our movie.
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
We'll do our best.
The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
This is my way of telling you --
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
I'm going to my mother's.
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
Yeah.  Exactly!
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
<u>Lugosi</u>??!  Didn't be pass on?
Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
Yes?
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
Um, I guess --
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific.  This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  <u>No compromises</u>.
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it!
What's uncanny?
So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work.
Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East.  She's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded. And here's the kicker: She's <u>very</u> <u>interested</u> in the picture business!
YES!  JUST DO IT!
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
Wow.
She doesn't give a shit about him.
What?
If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.
I do.
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
Yes?

According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
No. It's a mess.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television!
She could've been a nurse.
I'm at the hospital.
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
So you had sex with him?
Oh my god! On TV!
But Al is your husband now!
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
All right. Let them decide.
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
Oh... how come?
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
I really like you too...
Look at this.
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
Somewhere.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
You brought the girl!
Me?! That's you!
Hi, Shari.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
We have to stop meeting like this.
Sure.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Tu
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
Do it!
Dick... Dick,..
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
But, Mr. M. -
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
As far as I know, they--
Looks like Tim Kobza.
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Good for you.  Good for you
Yes?
Doing what?
I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
Hmm?
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
Here?
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
What do you mean?
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe it's time to give a little something back.
If you say so.
For what?
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Good luck to you too, Paul.
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
You know how they say one day a big meteor might come and crash into the Earth and kill everybody? Well, I think that would be a good thing.
Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
Till 19-fucking-70.
It's not what you think.
Did they deserve it today?
I'm not sure.
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
I don't know.
In the morning.
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
How what, Wendell?
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
Which one are you and which one am I?
What about him?
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
More's gonna cost you.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
What do you mean?
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
Someone must've pulled the records.
Just show me where they are!
I never truck with no sissies!
They shot him in his library.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper!
And what?
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
Something like that.
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
On what evidence?
All he found were rodents.  No signs of foul play.  So there.
I like it!  I like it!
Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?
Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
Really?  How?
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
And no one'll know about this?
I'm telling you, I--
Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
I don't know who he is.
Yeah.
I don't know what that means.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
I mean did you call anyone.
Jesus!
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
I was a traffic analyst.
They come after you?
Well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again.
What's going on?
<u>Here</u>?!
Tell me about it.
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
What if--
How?
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
Okay.
Your stuff?
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Anything at all?
For your wife?
Yes sir.
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
What do you mean?
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
What do you mean?
It's okay.
Well, you know--
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
I see her for business.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
I was in a car chase and a small explosion. Now listen to me: The NSA is behind this. They think that guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz, they think Zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them. So they're doing all these things <u>electronically</u>. The bank records, the surveillance. They're the ones who broke into the house. Now I know there's no reason to believe me. But I love you. And I love our son. So just believe me anyway.  Please.
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
You did good.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
You got a minute?
You're a moron, you know that?
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
We'd rather not--
Merry Christmas, son.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
She's in the kitchen.
Yeah.
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
The blender?
Ssh!
Jesus.
Bobby--
So do I!
Turn yourself in.
Yeah.
Are you still in Crystal City?
Yeah, what's going on?
What does that have to do with you?
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
It means who's side are you on?
I said fuck you.
Sir--
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
I don't care if he's Solomon with Saint Joseph sitting in his <u>lap</u>. I want the tape and I want him. Now is--
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
No.
What kind of fossils?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
The Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method.  Nothing to do with Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move.  The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards.  When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer.  Haunting the ostrich.
I do not.
Ask Al Auf. Almsy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
That makes it harder still.
I can't work.  I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
Arabic?
Don't go over it again, please.
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
Dance with me.
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
What?
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France.  The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling.
Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
I told you so.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
When's Clifton picking you up?
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
Shut-up!
A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse?  Great.
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
So was my Patient.
Who are his ghosts?
I don't know what that means.
I liberated it.
I can get in the back.
Oh, all over.
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
For?
Me?
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Off with his head!
Oh really?
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
How?  How can you see anything?
Well then - yes.  Of course.
Really?  That's sudden.
Why?  Is he staying?
You'd better be.
That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club.

I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.
I'll always go back to that church.
So one day we'll meet.
And what if he really is a spy?
Oh God.  Oh God.
Hello miss.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
I don't think so.
I'll come with you.
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
Who am I?
Meet me in front. Five minutes.
Are you...okay?
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.
You can't.
Oh?
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
Good morning.
We go underwater?
This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
No. It's a down payment.
Let's just see how we do.
Yes you did.
Thank you.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
The big job.
There is no big job.
Get the hell in.
I'd taken the Mask?
Transfer.
Can't be too careful.
It was wrong to deceive you.
They'll each be positive the other guy did it.  I fear an ugly international incident.
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
Because I never assume anything.
I'm terribly sorry old man.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
Thought you had to use some of these.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.
Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
Who?
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for them.  You got a minute?
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
I guess I'm not the right kind.
That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off.
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
That's crazy -- why not?
Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
No --
You didn't care about my case?
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
So what are you thinking?
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
<u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
So why would PG&E offer it?
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Erin --
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
You see your office?
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
And ...?
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
Ross.
Nope.  Maiden.
Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
I'm gonna hate it.
Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
We'll see.
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
Cause I don't even know you.
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
Fixing a leak under your sink.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
You are someone.
No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
Keep your voice down.
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
More than you need me.
I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
Next week.
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
You did?
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Yes, My Lord.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
The boy is our last hope.
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
Ben ... Ben ...
Luke ... you are the only hope.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
Everyone's invited, of course.
That was a long time ago.  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you.
Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
Barks his right on!
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
I'm against that.
Now you're making sense.
Where have I heard that before?
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
That's two you owe me, junior.
That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
I didn't say anything?
I understand.
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
Let's go.
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
Me too.  I was afraid.
Why not me?
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
That is why you fail.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
That won't be necessary.
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
Good God.
A display of primitive apparatus --
Please
I like you.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
I tried...
What?
Where's Plissken?
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
I don't know yet.
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
Having second thoughts?
Defense against what?
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
No.
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.
Where?
Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.
Who?
The what?
Sewers. Come on.
Who?
You're running out of time.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
Guenevere...
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
--I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've sewn my father's wounds more than once.
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
And you cannot love me...
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
That I cannot.
Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
I see, your excellency.
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
In here!
Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story, but other than that it was terrific.
Oh great, anything else?
And you got an invitation.
Dinner at the White House.
What's Burke got to do with it?
No. Not at all,
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Please.
Really? wow.
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
What man?
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Lies?
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
She used those words?
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
Please go away.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Didn't tell you of what she did?
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
But how?
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
No, is Regan aware of it?
No.
I found it.
Where?
Yeah.
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Captain who?
Oh you wouldn't talk, well I didn't have my make up man there.
Oh I love you.
Your not gonna marry him are you?
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
But you like him.
Well your thinking's not so good.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
God gets lonesome for us, Rags. He wants us back.
Damien Karras.
I've seen it.
You might loosen the straps then.
In time.
Who are you?
Uoy era ohw.
Okay
But deliver us from the evil one.
I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer.
Yeah, a fall.
Is that a threat?
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Be silent!
Do you have an appointment?
I don't know.
Just the same.
Honey ...
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
Frank.
No bones?
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Out.
What's the point?
Christ, will you look at your hair?
No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.
Huh?
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
Funny.  Strike a bell?
So do I.
Your older brother.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
It wasn't like that.
No?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
You're getting cold feet about this.
I'll drop the eighths.
Okay?
It's early.
She'll get here.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
Come on, stand still.
Get out of here!
That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?
Last?
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
Right.
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.  Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
Celebrating.  Join me?
You always threw up.
Maybe so.  You ever go back there?  Where it happened.
Who's weak now, big brother?
I'll take the Mallory.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
I can keep the beat.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
Right.
We're finished.
Don't take it personally.
You're an hour and a half late.
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
When we know.
Where's your dress?
Am I missing something?
Nine.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Did you hear it?
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Maybe.  I'll call him.
First times. Hey, look at this.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Yeah.
They must've bought the same map we did.
Huh?
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
Uh ... thanks.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
For a while.  She left.
It's been a long time, Ma.
Nothing personal --
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
Hey, business is business.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
You were good.
How do you know?
Sure.
No kidding?
Nervous?
You're kidding.
So, what happened?
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Yeah... No.
Yeah.
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
What happened to the donut king?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Ever go to church?
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
Merry Christmas.
Good to see you, Ma.
You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
Let me have a look.
A few blanks?  Like what?
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
Must've been after we got engaged.
Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
What do you mean?
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
And how much will your "fun" net you this time?
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
Pollux is -- what?
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
You can't blame me for trying.
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
You always say that -- then you leave.
I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
So you left her?  Just like that?
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
Why Jack?
A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
Im sure you do...
I dont think youre hearing me.
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
On a case by case basis...
Right.  Thats a major oversight...  So if Im Kate...I cant really afford the finer things, my husbands career is a crushing disappointment to me, Im trapped in suburbia...
Maybe I dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
It wouldnt really be cheating...  Its complicated.
Its me, Jack...
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we couldve been really good friends...
I mean it.  From what I can tell, were a mom and pop operation, were already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
Me?
Wow.  It must be great being you.  You got it all.
Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
What're you talkin' about?
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
I thought I saw you notice it at the kids recital.
I dont think so, thank you...
It would help me if we were.
Look, I dont know whats going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
No, youre right.  What are we doing?
We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
Jack...dont even start...
But its twenty degrees outside...
Youre having a bad day, Ill go with you...actually, theres no way in hell youre gettin me back out there...
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that.  But this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman...
Excuse me?
Thats why I work for Big Ed?
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
Ill just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
This is New York City, its like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
Youve been Jack Campbell.  And thats always a good thing...
Are you okay, Jack?
Dont worry about it, Jack...
So youre not at a non- profit firm?
Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
Aspen.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
Relax, it's casual.
Five times.
Victor's better at these things.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Don't you wander off, boy.
Baby, you're scaring me.
I'm worried about you.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
Is it safe?
And they're changing into...
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
That's terrible news...
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Johnny.
You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Hilarious.
Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
I don't want to <u>understand</u> it.  This isn't one of your science projects.  I just want to <u>fix</u> it.  <u>Fast</u>!
It's been changed.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
Excuse me?
Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
It's only for an hour --
Difficult? He's impossible!
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
But I did. I'm positive!
No, it requires such absolute precision --
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
Yes...
If we can go in past the Oculomotor Nerve...
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
No, there's no other way.
At an operation?
Request removal, Mr. Grant.
Send the following message...
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
That line was tampered with...
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Nothing has changed as far as <my> authority goes! He is <not> going to operate! Not in the little time we have left! There's no chance of success! It's sheer suicide for all of us!
That makes two of us.
Look at those Walls up ahead!
The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
What do you mean?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
No Jean, no money!
Can I see your license and registration please?
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
I need ...unguent.
Yeah.
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
Three people. In Brainerd.
Oh, for Chrissakes here -
Yah, okay, but, uh -
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
Any others?
Oh, now he's adorable.
Oh, don't be silly.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
Oh sure.
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Can you be any more specific?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
Uhn.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
Yeah, but -
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
What... What is it all about?
Uh-huh. Well, I'm a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and I was just wondering if you've had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass Ciera?
...Babe the Blue Ox?
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
but do you know that for sure without -
Sure right now! You're darned tootin'!
Yah, real good.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Yah!
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
Whatcha watchin' there?
Norstars.
You told me about it.
We might be innarested.
Well, they -
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
No way.
You don't think he's mixed up in -
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Ya gotta eat a breakfast...
Yah - how are you doon?
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
...Well, yah. Who's this?
The day of our homicides.
Yah.
Prowler needs a jump.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good.
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
That's terrific.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
We're still men.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
Really, what's that?
It means it was homemade.
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
I'll expose you.
Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.
Whatever.
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
We did make love?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
Who's this?
Who's this?
Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
Oxygen gets you high.  In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
What?
I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
A nice, big cock.
Is it?
The fight.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Good.  This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Yes, I promise.
It isn't... ?
Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
Why do people think I'm you?
I don't know!  Tell me!
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
You have jobs.
What about Marla?
I'm going to...
This is not about martyrdom.
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
Fuck you.
I quit.
Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons.  You need to get with the program.  Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.
Defuse the bomb, please.
I think this is about where we came in.
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
Why are you doing this?!
What?
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Did you hear what I just said?!
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
How you doing in there, hero?
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
What about the rest of you?  Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona.  Was Route 18 your first choice?
Take my van!
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
I never mad it.  The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
You're not listening to me!  You have to do something!
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
You said she was going to drive into a lake.  How can she when she's in protective custody?
I know how it feels to be dead.
I know.  I can feel it too.
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
What feeling?
Get out! Get out of the car!
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
That's a plan.
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
Design?
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
What's that?
Star Wars?
You stopped.
Start over.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
Batteries not included.
Where's your stuff?
Exactly.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
What's that?
Let me see.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
Yes.
You comin'?
Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand.
I thought he was with you.
Crazy motherfucker.
Nguyen is good boy.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
Where?
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
I know.
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
Really?
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
<u>What</u>!
You're all right... you sure...
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
And who's Lydia?
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
I... You're not going to understand this.
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
But..How could that happen?
Uh... basement I think...
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
<u>No!</u>  <u>I told you</u>! <u>You won a contest</u>!
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Where -- ?
Parry... I'm Jack.
I know...
Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
Who?
It's a classic.
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
Fuck you.
OWW...MAN...
No just Parry.
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
Got any Ethel Merman?
Well, it's enough for me.
I don't drink coffee...
I don't drink coffee...
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
Listen, you're very nice... b...
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
You have a disease.
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
That's right, hand.
You got another ball comin'.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'm going on over there...
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
What?
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
No kidding.
Who's Van Oost?
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Oh, well, what, what's he...
No...
Yeah, me, too...
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
There's nothing to say, Tita...
With applesauce?
Yeah, well, he's...
Where's Catherine?!
Bye, Robert.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
You don't call that music, though.
You had no inner feeling?
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
Some bath oil?
Something witty and devastating like that.
I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
Pardon me?
Yes.
If you want to call it that.
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
Why you have an attitude for?
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Alright.
Wussup.
What are you doin' here?
I just wanted to see you.
So what's her name?
She fucks it all up!
How old is he?
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
Not really.
Nah.
You mean her.
They didn't do anything.
Not luck. They don't want me.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
My God, you're serious.
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
That's Babar.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Margaret.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive.
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
That's it.
I agree.
You may be right.
Are you serious?
This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
Right.
No problem.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
What?
Twenty years.
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Charmed.
I want you to murder me.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
Don't say shoot, okay.
Spot right here.
Yeah.
That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
John Ultramalensky?
I ordered lunch.
Down boy.
Here, take mine.
I saved his life during the war.
Can I ask you a question?
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Yeah.
That's what I want to know.
Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?
If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
No.
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
Bastard.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
I recommend it.
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
Who are you?
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
Utah?
You'll have it.
Fletch.
Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
But I ain't got you...
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Actually, you may take it all now.
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
What did these Vancouver factories do?
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
What?  Jesus, tell me!
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Who cares about people?
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
Shock.
Golly, I'd probably faint.
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
Fuck me...
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
It is to us!  It's computerised.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
Did they follow you?
Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice.
Yes --
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
We must follow it.
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
Yeah!
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
How'd I know he had a knife.
He coulda been white.
What about the last of the big-time spenders.  You make him?
He probably sells insurance.  Owns a chicken farm in Hackensack.
Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
Third time around.
Pass.
Just for mistakes of parking?
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
What I know is what I told you.
Switches are shorted out.
I'm alright, Gibby.
I think I ruined the sauce...again.
Sure.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
Do you know how much I love you?
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
Frank...
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
Uh, huh.
Frank, this is insane...
Glad to hear that.
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
You just burned the desk.
I think I'm losing you.
I don't understand.
Something happened, something...
She just died, your mother just died?
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
How?
You all right?
Johnny, I know, but...
We got him!  Dad you got him!
You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.
Nothing you're willing to do.
Whoa, I just...I just...
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
Which means he probably knew her.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
What?
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
She's pretty special.
As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders.
Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
Sullivan?
You have the right to speak to an att --
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Cool it, Andy.
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
I know how to do it.  I mean, how do we do it in the hammock?
What?
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
It's Friday the 13th.
A hammock?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
Just keep your eyes on the road.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
You're wrong.
Great.  Just great.
Happy Friday the 13th.
I could swear I heard...
Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
Uh...yes.  But...
'Cause it stinks.
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
Boy scouting.
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
Will you listen, dammit!
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
No.  Not here.  Come by my house tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
The what?
Save your...
You food'll be right out.
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
I know everything about you, Diana.
N...nothing.
Good night, beautiful.
'Night, Josh.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Oh my God, Steven.
I'm now begging you.
I know what it sounds like.
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
I mean really never.
I'm literally going to kill you!
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
Hear what?
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
Where is she?
Oh dear God...
She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
He is not.
I'm staying.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
Why are you doing this to yourself?
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
You can and you will!!
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
It's not that simple.
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
What did you find?
Big mess every time.
Very bad today.
I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel.
Ride with me. We need a haircut.
Do not inhale.
What was it like?
Here we go.
No, we're not.
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
Paisley Porter.
Does it feel comfortable?
This could be it.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
What?
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
Because we're completely mismatched.
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
Except I won't have a father anymore.
I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
All right. What's been going on?
I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
You know the answer to that.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
Since when did that matter?
I lost it. I lose everything.
Show him who we are.
A grandmother. God bless you.
It's the kid's lucky day.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
It's a simple subject.
It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
Because faith is rewarded.
They're my team.
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
Sidney.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
Mine was cobalt blue.
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
Say it again.
You know what.
But you're here. So you must have come to me.
The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
What do you expect when you talk like that?
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
What was he like?
I thought you were against fighting.
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
Well, that's one victory.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
Who's leading them?
Who are you trying to convince?
Er, no...
I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going to be at least a head taller than you. Prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time.
It would be five thousand more.
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
No?  What's keeping you?
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
A man can change his face--but blood is forever. Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.  Intravenous.
Where do we start?
What's wrong with him?
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
How could they recognize you?  <i>I</i> don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  This is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken worse heat than this.  Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me now.  I've put too much into this.  Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>.  I had other offers, you know.  I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
I've got enough on my mind without that.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
Michael's.
You may as well invite her here.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
How do I square the accident?
It happened in Australasia.  He checked in yesterday.  No family complications, no record he ever broke his neck.  As far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life.  Excuse me, <i>your</i> life.
Not that.
Friend?
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
There's a problem, Lamar.
You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
No applause!
I bet.
Sure...
What do you mean? You've never been there.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Fatter... some things never change.
I'm still here, Doc.
I bought you a lot of new things.
Suit yourself.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
Do you mean that?
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
Let's do it.
I don't want to hear it.
What's wrong?
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
That little job cost me a hundred dollars... didn't even get to keep the fish.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Where?
Can't leave the desk.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
I know. I know.
'Good.'
Yeah.
Well, he drove it into the river.
That's nice.
Confidential, like.
Yes you can.
Address?
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Once a week you like a gentleman?
What was bugging Frank?
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
No, do you really?
Go on.
Really?
Really?
Yes, while he was here.
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
Of course. Where else?
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Expect so.
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
Yeah.
You coming to South America?
At me friend's house.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
That's what I was wondering.
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
It just would. He was always the same.
Right.
Where you off to?
It never is.
I'm sorry.
Pension him off.
Eric. Eric Paice.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
What? And get the clap?
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
I...I don't know.
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It's too...
It is.
You're on this...
It's not right.
...that's right...
He's doing very well.
I heard that they were running cold.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
You fucking build it!  Men come...
They have...
What?
What?
Yes...?
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
That's what I'm saying.  We were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin' leads out of the files...go to Jerry Graff.
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
We're not actually talking about it.
Did you?
We are?
Is that what I said?
What did he say?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
Absolutely.
That's ridiculous.
I didn't ask to be.
So I'm making it concrete.
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
They stole...
Yeah.
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
No.
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
In school.
I'm sure that we're insured, George... 
Did they get my contracts?
Anyone in this office lives on their wits...  I'm going to be with you in a second.  What you're hired for is to help us--does that seem clear to you? 
You're done, come down, and let's...
What about the other two?
...then...
It isn't me...
Let me...
You know what those leads cost?
...ah, fuck this...
I'm out.
Yes.
...they kicked out.
I can't do it, Shel.
Now.  Yes...When?
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
Because I say so.
The leads are coming.
Get 'em to me!
What does that fucking mean?
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
How do you know I made it up?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
No.  It hadn't.
I've got the check...
I'm sorry.
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Shit.
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
What does that mean?
Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
They...
Harriett...
What is it?
Kenilw...
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
Go ahead.
Twelve-fifteen.
Mm.
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
I don't know.  For me, I'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm.  Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. There was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me caf au lait.  She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.  Eh?  What I'm saying, what is our life?  It's looking forward or it's looking back.  And that's our life. That's it.  Where is the moment?  And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss.  What else?  The bank closes.  We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? None on 'em.  We worry anyway. What does this mean?  I'm not secure.  How can I be secure?  Through amassing wealth beyond all measure?  No.  And what's beyond all measure?  That's a sickness. That's a trap.  There is no measure. Only greed.  How can we act? 
I told you.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
I...
The power to negotiate.
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
What did I tell you?  What did I say about the three days...?
You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?
They didn't get my contracts.
You closed him yesterday.
Aren't you going out today?
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
I can't.
If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
Yes, thank you.
Bought at the airport.
Connie.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
No, Dad.
Not for strangers; for my country.
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
Because he's what we say... &quot;connected&quot;... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Kay... Kay...
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
Why didn't someone tell me!
Will you tell him?
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
I took care of it.
That plane goes to Miami...
I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.
He's going to try Panama...
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
Who's asking?
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
Not good.
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
I do not.
When do we talk?
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
Good.
I thought we would meet alone.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
The same assurance we got from you.
You want a war?
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
Sure.  I loved it.
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
He is dead now, twenty years.
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
Yes.  You were a Marine.
It's new.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
What?
I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.
This David's a friend?
Did you now?
I liked it.  We all did.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
I don't like to talk about that.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
Don't be ridiculous.  I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type.
Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
How long were you...?
Not me.
I was an officer.
Can't you see?  It's raining!
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
James Whale.  This afternoon at the party.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
You are much too human.
What did you expect?  Bronze?
It's too tight.
Ooooh.
I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
One likes to live simply.
Let's make it more interesting.  I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
Righto.  Let me see.
You didn't?
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
My monsters?
I am such a goose.  I mistook you for Cecil Beaton.  It's the hat. You're wearing one of Cecil's hats, you know.
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ...
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
What for?
You'll leave -- ?
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
You know my back.
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
What for?
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
C'mon, man ...
We're partners here --
You mean the poor --
Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
We don't -- ?
Mother -- !
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
What do you say, Toby?,
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
Hello, Memphis --
You, too
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
You hear me?
I know ...
Hospital.
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
Where we going -- ?
Call 'em here -- ?
You look like you lost your sheep ...
Buy you a drink?
On account of me.
And here I am...
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
Very good...
I do ... I cut "em...
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
Of course. Hi, Junie --
The hard part ...
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
What happened to Sway?
Right. You want to test the voltage drop ... Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ... See what you got ... You understand -- ?
Look at Jeannie's kid.
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
What?
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
Oh I Him.
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
I understand.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
With what?
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
Where's the stuff?
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
What?
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
There's a shovel at my mother's.
So do I.
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
He's with his friends.
What kind of person doesn't call?
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
What? Come on!
All right, then.
Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
Gone.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
No, I had to talk him down.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
I have about seventy-three...
Somethin's in my room.
Yeah, can I help you?
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
Well... I'll be speaking to your supervisor.
That's fine, but did you ever think--
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
Thank you, Will. I'll do that.
Yes.
Good to see you.
Since Nancy died.
Einstein. Had two marriages, both train-wrecks. The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum--
I do.
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
--And confuse him--
Oh, come on, Sean--
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
Come in.
I don't know. India maybe.
Hold up.
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
How about the ones on that shelf?
This is a real piece of shit.
What is?
That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
Why thank you.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
You're kiddin' me.
Do you have a soul-mate?
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
Do you want to talk about it?
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
The wrench, why?
It's not...
I know, I know...
Yeah, I think so.
Good for you. Congratulations.
I'm Will.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
No I haven't...
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
Exactly.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
Fine.
Want me to take a look?
It's important that I learn this.
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
What the fuck am I afraid of?!
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
Goodbye.
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
Lots must a died, too.
Gallon or two?
Okay. Go on.
Why, I guess so.
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Goodnight.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
I dunno. Payin' five now.
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
Get to what?
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
Got any plants?
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
I'm ready.
That's right. And douse some in it.
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
They know what--this fella looks like?
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look out for. And ain't nobody comin' back. They're gone-- and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world I am.
I can't help that. All I know is I got my orders. They told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what I'm telling you.
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
You do not.
Really...? So what?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
To make a long story short...
That's part of it.
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
You're fucking psycho.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
Like heroin?
Say more.
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
It's only natural....
Like a union?
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Nice talk, Sugarmouth.
Not bad. You?
Hey, Bob.
Nope.
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in '72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened.
No...
Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
What's a revival tent?
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
I think I'll go see Debi today.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
I have to get my head back into my work.
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
Doesn't matter.
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
That's up to Pilgrim.
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
You lived in Chicago?
When I was first married.
A jogger, huh?
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
She did?
OK. I'll stop talking then.
Yeah.
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
You don't.
Then why do you want to leave?
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
Little.
Tom?
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Hi.
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you?
Hi.
Yeah. Bye.
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
Aw... that's so sweet.
Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Huh-huh. You?
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
You're allergic to hay.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
May I have a suggestion?
What do you mean?
Tubab means white man.
Where to?
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem!  I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay?  Please.
There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese. He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow.  You hear 'bout that, Uncle T?
Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
Well, there's only one way to find out.  Give it a little gas.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
That must have been pretty special.
There's no hurry. Take you time.
How's Pilgrim doing?
You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
How long were you married?
Sometimes.
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
Shh!
Super hero like even.
Looks like a hacker wrote it.
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
Cereal.
Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
What are you doing?
Mm-hmm.
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
Blow me.
Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
Razor and Blade.
Joey's getting stupid busy.
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
Yeah. RISC is good.
If I win, you become my slave.
Make it our first date.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
I'll make it up to you!
How?
It's my subway defense system.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
The rabbit is in the administration system.
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
Excuse me?
I don't want to go to jail for this.
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
Pervert! What are you talking about?
So?
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
Just one moment.
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
We've been better.
Michael Myers.
We're trapped in this house.
Go!
It's okay..it's okay.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
I do.
Outside.
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
Double scoops?
It was the nightmare man
Oh Rachel!
Rachel!
Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
You knew. You just didn't care.
Right here, Ben.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
It isn't a man.
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
What's going on?
Uh huh.
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
You blame everything on kids.
Huh?
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Behind that bush there.
Bye.
That's probably all he can do.
What's this big, big news?
Is that all you say?
Yeah, sure.
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
I am.  I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
Sure...
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Okay. Later.
Hi, Tommy.
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
I couldn't if I tried.
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Mmm?
Oh.
Great.
Uh --
Yeah.
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
You're joking.
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Well...
Yes.
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
The hospital?  What kind of tests?
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
It's nothing.  Will you trust me?
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Yeah?
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
Oh, great.
I'm...all right.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
He's got like six gold records.
Yes, he's just adorable.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
I can't say anything!
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
Aren't they great?
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
That's where your talent lies.
Was I?
I don't know.
No!
It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
I am glad to see you.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
Oh, honey!
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Absolutely.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Mm-hm.
Me?
What are you going to use for money?!
No--
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
How are you?
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
Oh, now-- 
Huh?
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
That's really nice!
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
Tch.  He's such an angry...he's such a depressive.  I thought she was moving out!
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Oh?
I know, no--  I know.
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Yeah, that's clerical.
No.  She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things.
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
I remember you.
Good.  How are you?
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
No, well...I've been trying to write.
No, you can tell me.
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Oh, yeah?  What?
I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- 
I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
...<u>please</u>...
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
Or, perhaps...
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
Then I'm doing fine.
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
First things first.
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 
Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
I can make you rich.
I don't <u>think</u> so...
You nervous...?
Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  <u>Back</u> from America.  To your New Wife...  You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed.
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
The government says.  Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.  The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  You can't see Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty Cat.  That's what the <u>Government</u> says...
Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
...and my need for The Institution...
The girl needs help.
...what has she done to harm you...?
...what?
Because...?
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
"A liaison position with the Opera." 
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
I don't <u>think</u> so.
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
Yes.
...yes...?
Yes.
That's when you went to the Orphanage...
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
Because?
I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
Hey, it's not a crush anymore if                            ] you actually say it to the person                           ] you supposedly have the...                                  ] ] JASPER                                             ] Thought I'd get points for a post-                          ] modern approach to coming on to you.                        ]
Nothing.
I don't know about you dickweeds, but I gotta go take a nice, long juicy dump.
I think your condescension is even better.
You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I <u>almost</u> did something.
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
It's been known to happen.
This isn't about "doing it." I just think we need to talk some things out privately before...
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
Oh yeah, that's it.
Something like that. Will you do it?
I'll think about it.
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
What do you want from me?
No.
Yeah, I just got back.
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
Give me the clipboard.
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
I didn't. Cherry.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
That's good. Have you done this before?
Incredible similarity.
Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
Don't <u>even</u> talk about that stuff!
You kids are making too much damn noise.
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
Cool off, we're seniors.
Any contestants worth mentioning?
It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary.
What's that?
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
playfully shoves his hand away.
frowns at Henry.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
steps back.
Who cares!
Thank you so much!
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
Yes . . .
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
Well?
I understand... I won't-
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Yeah? You and who else?
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
What?
If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
Never to put you in my will.
What?
I don't work here.
This game is over do you hear me?
Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back.
You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
Try stupid.
That's good enough for me.  You better take that "letter" there and get rid of it.
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
Here!  Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks.  How much have you got, Chucky?  Give Mister LaPlante your money.
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
Well, for your child's sake, show some decency then, rise above your sleazy instincts.  You may have already killed him!
Were you in it?  In the war?
You never saw that picture, huh?
What picture?
JOEY!
Mmmmm.  Well, it's complicated. Maybe when you're older.  Anyhow, what I'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay?  It don't go no further.  What happened is, you remember that night I was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch, ..?
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
You do?
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
You didn't... get it on with him?
I didn't ask him.
How are they with kids?
So this really does the trick, eh?
They're really white.
Where are these toys of yours?
What toys do you have?
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
That would be stupid.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
It is tomorrow.
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
Holly -- that's not so.
But there's this <u>psycho</u>.  Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with <u>every day</u>.  I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
Whew.
Stop knowing me so well.
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
What?
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
He wasn't there.
What?
Oh, honey.
There might be some extras in the garage.
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
I think it's time I came home now.
Shut up.
It's fun.
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
-- A man.
No.
No man!  <u>Go to your room</u>.
It's a double.
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.
Why?
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
It's circumstantial.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
Central Park.
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
Around.
Caution shows wisdom.
Aye.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
I would like to say goodbye.
I'm leaving in the morning.
Then take me with you.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Why are you doing this?
Are you a cop?
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
You're twenty minutes late.
I've lived all over the world.
Yes -- it is.
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
You don't really believe this do you?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
I've seen it.
And the other one -- he is like you?
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
I don't know.
I know.
Me too.
Aye -- that I would, lass.
Yes.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
You wanted to let Sonny handle it.  I would've moved in when we first found out.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
I'll make the call.
No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there.
What if he's dead?  What if you killed him?
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
Celebrate what?  Going to prison?
Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
I'm here.
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
We don't have time!
They'll cut the power.
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
How about dog shit?
If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see that?
How can we get out?
York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
We only have eight officers on duty, Chief.
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
Order your men to stand down.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
I can get into the den.  The office is right across the hall.
These disks . . . where are they?
Let me see your identity card.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
And four children?
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
Yes we have.
I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
Satellites?
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
The high command? Our high command?
The police are very busy.
I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
Bring back your policemen...
When?
No.
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
You think they will believe you?
) You cannot kill them all.
Fuck you.
Of course.
Very soon.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.
He will be here.
What?
I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
Do as I say. I will be there soon.
You cannot go alone.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
Tell me what it was.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
You have taken business class?
When?
Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
So what stopped her?
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
Ms. Marr!
Can't imagine by who. I don't suppose the truth would interest you: that I've never had another wife but Evelyn.
I don't know!!
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Take the gun.
-- yeah, we did that --
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
You're starting to sound like Pritchett.
It'll have to do.
All the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there's got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn't just appear out of thin air -- there's got to be pulleys, cables or something, that make them go up and down.
I don't do groups.
I hope not.
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
I know.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
Where is she?
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.
No, no, it's just --
I never saw you --
-- it wasn't me.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War.
Why not?
Blackburn's dead.
He would have been back by now.
These records only go back to 1880. But...  ...wait a minute...
I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  And who died here.
There's no need to be.
Where is she?
My God, I heard something!
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
It's dark!  I can't breathe!
Well, that all depends.
Good night daddy.
The place is pretty dusty.
What will Aubrey think?
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
So what are you saying?
Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
No...  NO!
I'm ok.
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
Maura.
Did you remove anything in the cellar!
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!
Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
There's something through that wall!
I don't know!  Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall!
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Right.  Right!
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
That's great.
What?
Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
Here!  Here!  Pull over!
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
Unh-unh.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
Because you want to.  You've always wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look at your sculptures.  Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you.
But how in God's name ...
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
"Maybe we're ragged and funny."
Get em....
Too-do-loo, babe.
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
Oh, I'm so sorry...
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex. Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...
But you're going to tell us anyway...
You certainly do.
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
Snappy.
The Shazzammeter!
The Hipster!
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
The Hoop-dee-doo!
He didn't look unhappy!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
...Why don't I just type this up...
Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam...
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Wait a minute!
Hmmm.
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
Ya don't say.
He notices.
I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
At the Houmfort.
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
I'm afraid so.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  "You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?"  What he could do to that word "beautiful." That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists.
Yes, thank you.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
I've never given it much thought.
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
You admit that it is terribly dangerous. Why do you advise it?
And as usual no one believed me...
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
That shirt?
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
That one.
What do you mean?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
The phone's out.
Good.
Fine.
All the more reason for this little heart to heart... great.
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
What do you think we're doing, dad?
I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess...
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
A key party?
Oh Wendy.
It's really quite all right.
How'd you know?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Forget what?
That's right.
That I will indeed.
I gotta get to English class.
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
Flame on, asshole.
And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
What do you mean?
Moisture! Moisture!
What is it?
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
How do you know this shit?
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
No one.
I don't know.
You get in trouble?
Nixon, doofus! It's incredible. He should be shot.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
And?
Hey Sandy.
What are you doing?
They left it in the jungle.
Good.
What's the D.A. got them on?
Actually...
Twelve years younger.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
Okay.
Five feet?  Seven feet?
Worth pursuing?
Where is he?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
That's right.
How do you mean?
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
Don't do this, Hap...
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep.
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
That's what I said.
What was it?
Thought you might find that.
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
I was a mentor to her.
Yes.
There's nothing more to talk about.
Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
This an accident, Walter?
If you want it to be...
Surely you know the one who made you...
Then there is nothing.
If you say so. You are innocent.
Then blame the one who made her...
Then I leave too.
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
It will grow back again!
What plans?
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
Why not?
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
Yes...
You've just done it -
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
I don't know any hell -
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
Are you mad????
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
The story about stakes through the heart?
And did you lose her? Did she go?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.
Wait...Did you say off-season?
What the hell would you call this?
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
Karla! You promised.
Then, we fight --
I'm right here. Grab my hand.
...Nancy?
Ray, we're just friend.
Why are you being like this?
You don't seem fine.
Right. Now I remember.
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
Why?
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
I said we start having fun. And that means now.
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
No. I shot him.
You don't have to be a jerk.
It is my home.  My name is Hugo Albrecht.
Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
All the graves?
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
My last name is Pherides.
You and your mysterious illness. A new attack everytime you are crossed  everytime you can't get your own way.
Wouldn't I?
Yes?
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure - quite sure.
Damn me, if I know. She's become so much a member of our household I never think of her by any name but Thea -- she has a last name --
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
Why -- no not before Thea came 
When you make sense I'll listen.
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .
I said I wish I'd never been born.
Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You . . .  . . . wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea.  What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right.  You've got your wish. You've never been born.
You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
Zuzu's petals.
Sit down? What are . . .
Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
Who is it?
Well, wait and see.
No!
I know. I know.
I know that girl!
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Well, what happened to you?
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
Uh-huh.
A cattle boat?
Hmmmm . . .
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Oh . . .
Aw, get going!
Oh, George.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Hello, Vi.
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know.  Well, I've said too much. I . . . You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!
Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?
I don't like coconuts.
Beautiful.
I'm going to scream!
Do you like it?
Thank you.
I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
Darling, you're wonderful.
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Oh, George, George!
You have no idea what's happened to me.
I've eaten.
Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
Huh?
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
Hmm? Well, I . . .
What?
Shut up.
You bet.  Hang on....
Can you get us a line?
No!  It's still there!
Then check it out.  I'll be in the office.
Not the drugstore!
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
Not till next year.
Pop.  I'm sorry.
It's okay.  What happened?
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
The whale's mouth?
The Shark's mouth.
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Is there one in these waters?
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Probably.
So there's one around here.
Can't you tell?
Right.
Nothing, huh?
Yeah.   I think so.  Mike!  Keep it down, for chrissake!
Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.
That you were fired.
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Yeah?  Then what?
That's what he said.
I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay....
Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
Hang on, hang on...Okay, go.
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
That's a crock of shit.
Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
I can't stop thinking!
Nope.
Give me back my hat!
Double nope!
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
Anything.  Anything.
That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
I'm going.
What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
What the hell is it?
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
Good.  I'll be on the dock at eight.  Eight o'clock, everybody!
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
What about me?
You always go with Andy.
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
He thought he had a good reason.
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
What is it, 97 days?
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
How come?
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
They just wanted to say hello.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
Are you coming...?
I'm okay.
Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac.
No.
It's my new perfume.  Great White, the Man-Eater.
Okay.
Sure.  Let's go.
Well, that's why you got it.
Yes, you can.
It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
You wanted to know about a cave?
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
Like hell!
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
I like it when they wake up.
Philip.
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
Thanks to you.
He.  She.  Let's blow the bitch up!
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
Don't blame yourself.
Sure.
Yeah, from Boston.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
'Course they're also so rich.
You like Florida?
How come?
I don't know, what else is there?
SEAN!
Yes, there is goes.
Calvin said it was all right.
Got a job for me?
He needs a haircut.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
I don't want to.  I want to swing....
Yes, I did.
We need beer....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
No....
I have work....
I'd be afraid of losing....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
Stop what?
You check it....
Mommy lets me....
Dad died from a heart attack....
You're not a pain in the ass....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
It could have been an accident....
You're doing fine.  I'll keep you out of trouble.  Relax....
Good.  I have two left....
I have my own little island.
I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
The wind does that.  Ever been to the Bahamas before?
I fly elephants for smugglers....
You're afraid of the competition out there....
You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
I forgot my rubber gloves.  Let's do it.
Here it comes....
Is it your vehicle?
A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is "Jennifer <u>Eight</u>."
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
What is all this Jennifer stuff?
No, Sir.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
Three or four.
And did they?
Wrong cabinet.
Just walk away from me, Taylor ..
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
Yes.
You should. It's wonderful.
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
I know.
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
Who sought the warrant?
You find something curious in that?
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
Listen to me, it's over.
Now what did you lose?
And have fun at your bachelor party.
-- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah, what happened there.
What?
Okay... I will...
I don't know --
What about Ray?
He's in the living room asleep.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
Thank you.
Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74.
It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...
You know I don't do "contracts." But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Here it is.  "Show me the money."  Show.  Me.  The.  Money. _ 36.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they do is ignore me...
Another drink please.
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
No, I air-dry.
No, I'm saying to be --
Fine.
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
Then you gotta have The Talk.
No, you're --
Damn right.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98.
Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. _ 124.
-- and I'll get 'em.
You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --
Funny...   I better go to bed.
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
What?
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
Nothing you haven't seen before.
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
So do you.
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
Nothing.
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
DAD!
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
We should take it with us to signal any planes.
Billy, I can't talk to you now.
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
Raptors, mostly.
You think they could talk to each other?
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
On the island.
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
Why?
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
Back out! Move!
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
Just a little bit too much, I think.
It certainly does.
It doesn't matter what I think.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.
-- my --
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
Which one?
Well, is he?
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
You version of it.
What are they?
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at this!  You could-
What's that?
Feeling a bit blue, are we?
Why did you come here?
But why?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
Where's Ian?
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
Oh my God.
Could I have a tissue please?
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
Why?
Look.
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
They smell.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Alan?
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
Yeah.
Really?
Maybe -- it's hard to say.
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Nope.
Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
You have no idea.
to Ellie) You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?
Yeah, they hate me.
I didn't say I was scared.
What?  What can we do?
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
What does he mean by "target audience"?
It's safe.
Alright.
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
All night?
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
John, John.
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
No, but...
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
None of that's true?
No. You've told me all I need to know.
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
_It's a second REM pattern_.
Not yet.
Great.	When can you do it?
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
An empty tomb?
A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look --
A true friend would do it.
No, I left it in his office.
Yes.
Sit down, Kafka.
Well, I --
I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
What?
-- What could he have done to warrant that?
You won't have any trouble finding it.
He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.
He was murdered.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
We know that.
What did she say?
Then why haven't I been --
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
Yes.  Isn't it there?
It's gone out so quickly?
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
Do they have him on display at the weekends?
Value? ... Value?
Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
I can't imagine you crying.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
Y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
You better not slow us down, Denham!
The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
What's that?
Well she's not now.  I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could've had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink!
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
No.
-- Yes.
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
I said yes, I see.
Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
OK.
No thanks.
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
Well, let's go down and ask him.
No.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
Why?
Ligourin: How could you do it?
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
Two years ago? Sorry.
She told me.
Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
I know Tom Grunemann.
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
Tell me, does your daddy ever hit you?
Welcome to the... 
Sorry.
In a minute...
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
That's okay...
I hate it.
All it is is onions and gravy.
Yeah?
Sleep tight.
Sure.
Sure.
Yep.
Sure.
Are you going to get remarried?
Like a principal?
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
No, I did not.
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
And what is your present salary?
I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
And how did you find his work?
Was he unfaithful?
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
Yes.
How long was that?
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
I'm not taking him with me.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Ted, do you love him?
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
Kramer...
I don't believe you.
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Oh, no..
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
All right...Okay...But let's get something straight, right now. I mean, I'm sorry about what happened between you and Joanna, but it's not my problem, understand?
I'm sure.
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
What d'you tell her?
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
Uh, huh...
Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
Please, Thel...
Kham, Holiness.
No cried?
It is alright, Father.
And you have horses? You love horses.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
I will buy them for you.
And we will begin with tearing it down.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Yes, but they say he did.
Yes.
Me. First break of day.
The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too.
Tell me.
Britain?
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun.
It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
What do you think?
True.
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
I am braver.
I have smarter men.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
I would not know. Maybe.
I do.
We cannot.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
What would you do, Holiness?
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
Like my mother.
Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
No!!  Out!
I do <u>not</u> like you.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
What the hell are you doing?!!
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
<u>Hector</u>.
What's going on?
Excuse me?
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
I'm sorry but you're...
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
I heard something.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
You wanna ride in my truck?
Good thinking.
White perch.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
I got nothing against--
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
<u>You</u>?
No.
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
Hot damn, Clarice.
Good idea.
Thanks.
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
I am, yes.
Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.
It's much better than your shoes.
Five... so far.
All flayed...?
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
Who killed your patient?
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
By the book, he's a sadist.
Was it a butterfly?
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
Then tell me how.
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
Let us go, miss.
You knew them.
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
Yes. I want you to go.
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
When? How?
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
You still have an aversion to the water?
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
I don't understand!
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
Your enemy...
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
You forget yourself!
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
Webb's at Edward?
Sir!
Excuse me. What did you say?
Does the rule of English law no longer govern?  Has it been replaced by absolutism?
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
Granted, Monsieur.
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
That's an order!
Fuck your orders!
Just get in yours!
Why can't we pick up his signal?
Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
What's wrong with it?
Roger.
Ahhhh!
Beautiful.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
Not yet.
Russian.
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
Oh man, that's just great...
The air's stopped.
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
Seven hundred for the pair.
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
And Tom took care of them.
It's a Samoan pub.
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
Can I help?
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
Plank?
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
He means they're thieving dogs.
Why, what's up?
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
I will loan you the money.
For half a million?
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
And?
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
I think you're Nick the Greek.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
At what, exactly?
Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
Leave your sister out of it.
Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
I do, sir.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
He'll live.
He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
You got a cause of death?
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
I'm not picking it up.
Now or later, Charley. You won't have any trouble finding me.
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
You look good--
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
Uncle Al--
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
But they were Indians themselves.
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
Dad--
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
No.
You own this place?
You lived in the States for a while?
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
Maybe.
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
It's a .45.
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
Pleased to meet you.
You get much of that in here?
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
Eladio Cruz.
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't worry. We've got her.]
Me llama Eladio Cruz--Bienvenido a Tejas. [Welcome to Texas.]
Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid]
I have some friends who have had a accident--
No es la verdad--[That isn't true--]
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
And I understand why you might want to think he could.
You thought any more about our murder?
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
Do you?
Hey, Sam.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
Why would I want to go there?
He was killed.
A little older than Paloma is now.
I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--
And when my father was Sheriff?
What do you think?
It was for personal consumption.
I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
Amado.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
I've felt that way, yeah.
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
You sell much out here?
Hell of a spot to put a business.
So when did Buddy leave?
Payne.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
Runnin' numbers without I know about it is both illegal and unhealthy. You remember that.
Thirty-five bucks.
Nix.
It'll be something hokey.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
Why would I do that?
He's a priest?
No.  He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit.  Like you.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
Yes.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
You don't?
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
You didn't marry him for love.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
He was the real thing, right?
Stuff?
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
And they all came...
I left three messages already.
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
--vanished.
Heaven and Hell?
What about Swann's miracles?
What's the difference?
Are you a believer, then?
Why'd you come here?
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
You want more money, is that it?
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
Yes...
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
Or murdered, like Nix.
It's me betrayed him.
Help me.
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth.  Are you ready for that?
Can you do it?
What about Philip Swann?
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me
Liar!
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
How long have you been married?
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
No, you smiled.
We established that we have no communication.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
Working.
Thanks.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Yes?
Do you like massage?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
That sounds great  can you hold on...  What Zoe?
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Hi, Lydia.
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
I don't know.
What?
Like Japanese food.
Fine. Is it going ok?
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
Excuse me?
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
What?
Bye.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
It's ok if you are.
Claire...
Eight.  That okay?
You have to tell me who did it.
My secretary?
No, I wasn't, actually.
But bad judgement.  And now you see how dangerous the consequences can be.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Well I know he's come here before.
Peter Kelson?
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
Maya?  What do you mean?
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
He's looking right at me.
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
What happened?
Where is she now?
Had to let her go.  I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
You sure?
Are you okay?
You're a caterer?
Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do.  Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
Careful.
Uh-huh.
I don't wanna see that.
Get used to it, babe.
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
Just one word of advice for next season.
What's that?
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money.  I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball.
Just not my type, I guess.
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
Uh huh.
I never knew a girl that could play.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
He works at a bank.
Shut up!
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
So she's honest.
God, here we go.
I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
Yeah.
Here I am.
Nobody.
The "man" again.
Woman...
Cheap date.
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
Thanks.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
Oh yeah?
So...how's the knee?
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on.
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
With who?
Keep your voice down.
What's that, not great?
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Yup.
That's right.
You know, people.
Okay...
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
What?
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
I ain't a damn liar.
Good.
Yeah.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
Does this sound weird?
What kind of Cancer?
My mother had breast cancer.
Sure is.  So why call me?
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
Yeah.
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
Thank you.
What's that stand for?
If you're not here for a 422 --
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Good bye.
Well...is that illegal?
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
No, no.
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
I lost my gun.
I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
It doesn't matter.
What?
How much time do we have?
Not enough, what do you want?
I'm, I need to go, I'm gonna --
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
Son, please, now....
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
This sounds threatening.
Is it real love?
Well --
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
My name is Donnie Smith and I have lot's of love to give.
-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
I've seen it before.
You got it.
It's ok.
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
....getthat on the tv....there...
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
Alright.  Thank you.
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
-- let's talk more about your background --
I would just want to clear some things up:
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
Yeah.
You requested my time and I gave it you, you called me a liar and made accusations. And you say, "If I'd known I wouldn't have asked," then it's not an attack?  Well, I don't wanna be the sort of fella who doesn't keep his word.  I gave you my time, Bitch. So fuck you now.
Around here.
Hollywood, mainly.
Why does that sound silly?
Are you close?
Right.
...this close...
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
It's interesting.
...ok...
Calm down.
I am calm.
There's no disturbance.
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
Then what?
Yeah. Yes.
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
Rose, I don't --
How long with Ellen?
What about now?
Do you have any children with anyone?
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
I love you so much.
Maybe...I don't...
No.
You're her boyfriend?
I'II go....is it...back here?
Saucy-saucy.
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
Shut the fuck up.
BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT HE DIDN'T ASK YOU, HE DOESN'T WANT HIM, HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM, SO FUCK YOU THAT HE ASKED THAT. THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME AND HIM.
....it's alright....
mmm.hmm.
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
Do you have that?
Maybe.
You're late, not me.
-- I didn't see you from the window.
Sure.
Go to bed.
I have money to give you.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
It's raining frogs from the sky.
No, stay back!  Stay back!
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!!
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
I am with you!
Making the key to the throne.
About to hang himself, I should think.
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
But I was on duty...
Why didn't you say so?
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
Your Majesty has had many women --
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
What number, on the first page?
What was the end page?
Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
I... we are humble people...
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
Yeah?
Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
Did you report it stolen?
Fine -
Where do you come from, Marvosa?
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
Yeah...they did.  One girl...
What happened with the tape?
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
Let's see what we got...
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
Long gone... MARVOSA Well you won't mind if I don't take your word for it, right?
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
Book code?
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
You said the guy down here is good.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
What do you want to do?
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
Why?
See? You do know something about him.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
I won't be here.
When are you coming back?
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
What?
It's happening again, Jack...
Will. Get right back here. He just called.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
Let me stick this in the black hole.
Tonic will be fine.
I'm fine.
No!
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
Yes.
I don't know...
Yes.
No.
Dr. Chilton.
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
No. I can help you.
Atlanta and Birmingham.
I don't want to do that,
Goodbye.
Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.  Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have.
I call him a monster.
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Me, too. And very erotic...
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
I love you...
I remember.
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
Can you quit?
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
What's that?
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
No.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
You got it.
Tank you veddy much.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
No.  Caspiar.
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
I refuse.
LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
Those are my terms.
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
Tony Clifton.
You've got good days and bad days.
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
You're a wimp.
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
Oh.
Er, yes.  Speaking.
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
They're gonna lynch him!
Why isn't he MOVING??
Bob Gorsky.
Yes.
It's my name.
Oh, God.
Two grand.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
The Matrix isn't real!
Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean, all I do is pull a plug here.  But there, you watch a man die.
Midnight watch.
The Matrix?  Yeah.
Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
How?
Go.
He's beginning to believe.
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
No.
Do you want to know what it is?
That I would find the One.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
Yes I do.
Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
What?
From you.
Is it?
She told me...
What happened?  What did you see?
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
Not yet.
Hell yes!
How?
Why?
Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away.  You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
Kennedy.
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
Listen...I'm a guest here.
I could have told you that.
I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
Come on.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
You getting out too?
Let's go to the movies...on you.
He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
Chinese food?
No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
What was it?
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Anything specific?
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
This is a heisted car!
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Can you spare it?
Sure.
You think so?
His wife?
He's cute.
I know you do, darling.
And you could care less --
Who?
Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
You mean this, sir?
You're taking this too far, Drew.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
In my sleep.
Maybe, who knows?  You know how voices are.  Let's go.
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
Is there any more to it?
I get the feeling you've done some business before.
Glad I could be of some help.
What are their feelings?
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
Yeah, that's what he said.
'It's up to Joe'?
No, no.  I on holiday.
Don' need you okayin'.
No.  Nothing.
Yes?
Thanks.
Love.
You love Allison, don't you?
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
I don't mind --
I appreciate you --
I mean I appreciate that.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
Has her pain abated?
Yes.  I'm tired.
Why don't you get off his case?
How beautiful.
More than you love peanut butter?
Hold me --
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
'Threw' you?  Where?
No.
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
Not at all.
Sounds fair enough.
Yes?
You've got a deal.
So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
You were just curious?
Are you going to fire me, Bill?
What are you saying, that it's time to go?
I think you heard me, Bill.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
Yes.
You fill the bill, Bill.
You should hope quite a while.
And then --?
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
I didn't ask any question.
It's enough now.
Quiet.
I want to have a look around before I take you.
The 'question' --
Bontecou Day.  Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
Yeah, I give a shit.
You think Drew will go for it?
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
Drew told me.
He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
Nothing.
Then what will you say?
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
I'm having a helluva time.
Oh, yes --
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
I'm sorry --
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
So you're a one-girl guy?
Because I like you so much.  Now I've got to go.
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
What can I do for you, Leonard?
Burt.
So you're holding my calls?
As requested.
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
Why?
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
I wasn't helping you for money.
Yeah. You?
Yes.
Kill him.
There are things you know for sure.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
Well, that's me.
I don't know.
Thank you.
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
Lenny, is that you?
John Gammell?
Guess I've told you about my condition.
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
Probably left it in your room.
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
I don't know.
Fucking hope not.
Natalie who?
Prove it.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
She couldn't.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
But he's not the right guy!					  *
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
Why would I have a gun?
"And" what?
You can't.
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
Sure.
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
I dance...
Exactly.
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Available cash is not an issue for us...
Hola, viejo.
Of course.
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
Sit.
Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Something's wrong.
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
What's the point?  It's going down.
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
Have faith.
I don't understand...
Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
I had to lay eyes on you.
Alonzo...
What...?
The Statue of Liberty.
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
You sure are a pretty lady.
Sure you're all right?
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
Don't say nothing about you either.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess.
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
They gotta be.
I'm wet.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
You want me to leave?
This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged!
Get down -- where?
I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
Two kilos.
You want to split your hernia again?
They went out over there: must be some kind of exit.
Shit.
I know.
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
What do you mean?
What?  You gotta be joking.
After we're outside the kogus?
It's already been cut.
Max - where?
For Christ's sake, just GET on the plane, okay!
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
Learn what?
The lawyer?
Yeah...?
You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
No...
You did!
Don't get kinky here...
I'll be late.
Maybe they lied to you.
Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
Susan, we're not b-
What-
Peter-
Oh, Jesus.
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
Nothing.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
No problem.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
Then who did?
So you've indicated. Do it.
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
Annie, what's the matter?
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
To Misery.
It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.
I'm glad you like it.
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
Ahh!!!
Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
That'd be a first.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
More like two-two point two million.
Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty.
I hope there's a place to land.
What if I pay the rent?
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
Oh Ethan!..
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
No.
Like what?
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
Excuse me?
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
Very.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Yes.
By fire.  That's the best way, really.
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
That simple, huh?
I told her to get outta there.
Nyah still on the property?
Good job.  And thanks.
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
So what do you suggest?
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
Hes putting on a show, Barnes.
What kind of show.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
What happened to Jim?
What?
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
I always have, Claire..
Youre in Prague?
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Dont disappoint me.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
The arms dealer.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Very good.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
Let's move!
Time up.
Jim we cant.
Why?
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Youre probably right.
You got it.
They stamped it, didnt they?  Those damn Gideons.
What's going on?
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
Johnny Cammareri.
Let's go tell your Mother.
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
Hurry up.
He's in Palermo.
Yes.
I have no life.
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
Loretta.
Where'd Johnny find you?
Just Johnny.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
I'm telling you your life!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
Take it easy.
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
What did you do?
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
What are you talking about?
Alright.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Yeah. It smells like snow.
You're making me feel guilty again.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
Right.
Bobo, take the cart away.
On the floor?
Alright.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
We should talk alone.
I can't. I need my family around me now.
Where's the ring?
Pop don't like Johnny.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
And we'll sell the house.
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
What's the matter with him?
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
I came right from the airport.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
But absolutely!
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Will you join me for dinner?
What do you do?
That woman was a student of yours?
Then why are you eating alone?
I'm a little cold.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I'm too old for you.
My God, it's a mansion!
He's a plumber.
I knew she had it.
Did you dress her up like this?
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
Through ... We found them.
King of the WHO?
I am your king!
Well, I didn't vote for you.
You don't vote for kings.
Who are they?
NI!   NI!
All right!  What do you want?
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
One that looks nice.
None shall pass.
Well, what's that then?
I've had worse.
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
My liege ... forgive me ...
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
Greetings King Arthur.
... You silly sod.
You got us all worked up.
I warned you!
Yes, I see.
Bloody peasant! 
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
What is your name?
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
Listen, Alice ...
How?
Well ... I'll tell you ...
If we ... er ... 
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
No, not anyone else - just me.
Just you ...
And make sure he doesn't leave.
The Prince ... ?
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
You are in great peril.
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
I don't think I was.
We must examine you.
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
When danger reared its ugly head, He bravely turned his tail and fled Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about And gallantly he chickened out Bravely taking to his feet He beat a very brave retreat Bravest of the brave Sir Robin Petrified of being dead Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin Turned away and fled.
I speak as I find, Archie.
Not bad, not bad.
Sixty.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
She'll be worried about me.
Get out.  Out!
What do you take me for?
It's cold out there tonight, Barney.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Yeah.
Are you all right, Barney?
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
The future King!
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
Mama...
Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.
That's not good enough.
Aye, do.
We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
I am a blank sheet.
You're injured.
Oh.
This is the top.
Then I envy yo.
No loyalty.
No love.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
Ma'am.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
He thought so, yes.
Who by?
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
To keep out the cold.
Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
Because I have to! 
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Mrs Brown.
What's her excuse this time?
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
Of course.
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
And now I am back.
I have no idea.
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
How do you do that?
Turn if off!
So how did it know my name, then?
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
Nick, what is it.
The Police, then...
They made ARCADE.  It's still a game, right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
No I'm not...
Get that helmet.  If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible.
Yeah.  The Inferno.
You didn't hear me?
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
What?!  There's nothing here!
Look around...
Thought so.
Yes...but...how did you...
That's impossible.
Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?
So how do I start?
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
The Cowboy??
Cynthia...what's going on?
Will you meet with him?
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
Okay.
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
You got it! See you later honey.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Very pleased to meet you.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
No  There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it.  There are things there.... but I'm... here.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
Good luck!
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
Not a coke or anything?
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
Pick with expediency !
Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.
No !
Why should I ?
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
I don't know.
We have to climb up that.
McCay knows ?
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
I'm listening.
How long till the room fills ?
Is this really the time ?
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
That's a shame.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Hey , Hey !
Just shut the fuck up.
Trust me, if you open any door, you'll be dead a whole lot sooner.
And that's different than this because...... ?
You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
I said NO.
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
Excuse me, sir ?
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Sir ?
He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
I do believe Mr. McCray will be most pleased with the tape of this one.
I can see that but where ?
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
We just having our first date when you showed up.
Of course I am. I feel the testosterone coursing through my veins.  Now that I've gotten the stitches removed from my arm and the chiropractor fixed my back.
Why don't you shut up now.
I'm going to go ahead and go now.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
This is California, anything is possible.
Me, I'll know!
What do you remember about her.
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Was it a nice funeral?
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
You're being narrow-minded.
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
Special effects?
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Come on in!
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
What can I do for you?
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
But we made a business deal.
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
Does it work?
Boyfriend?
Just give it to me!!
Just come and get it...right here!
It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.
Really?
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
For the mini-bike fund.
Phil, I think you should consider... fades as Vada walks off
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
Is that a yes?
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Is there milk in them already?
Well you've gotta be prepared.
Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Keep your voice down!
What?
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
I think it's still available.
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....
Good.
Goodnight.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Then who's it for?
Dad??
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
What are you doing.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
No, no no....
No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
Come here, sit down over here.
Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.
Does he love her?
Sure.
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
Have you ever tried any?
The boys at school don't think I am.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
What are you saving for?
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
Oh no!  UUH.
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
No, I don't wanna.
Heaven.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
Bed wetter!
You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
What?
For their meat.
I dunno..
Something like that.
He's still in love with you.
We're about to find out.
She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!
When I'm talking to children.
... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
He said that, too.
... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
What? Because I'm a little understand...
But he sure can kiss.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
... except one.
Ju...
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
Exactly what?
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
I can't wait for you to meet her!
My very point.  Here's another one...
Waiter! Check, please!
Till the gas ran out.
She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
Never can tell.
Michael!!
Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!
Except for that.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
That is so romantic.
If you find her...
The most important thing. Is being together.
... and you knew about this.
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
What?
I hate that music.
You'll have to speak up.
What did you say your name was?
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
How is that?
Your job, huh.
That's what he wants.
Hi. Come on in. Mary!
Don't you worry. We're just having a quiet Sunday at home.
Whose?
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
To the bathroom.
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
I haven't gotten into politics yet. I'm still into music --except for you. You're into politics.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
She had on high heels?
No.
Nash.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
When did you start singing?
It just is.
Do you like him?
I'm here.
Wrong.
Oh.
I'll be there.
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Might be good for you.
Sleeping.
No, we never did that
You serious?
Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
You got something you want to do?
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.
You been followin' the news coverage?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
What?
Look, I'll trade you.
Yes, sir.
Ready.
Wagons, hooaaa!
Yours.
Don't worry about it.
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
Okay, let's cut it.
Where's it parked?
On average forty million.
So, what now?
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
Unfortunately, yes.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
It's hard to say Capt'n.
Next week's episode.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch. Small, intricate, compact...it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. Because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand.
Out.
Come on, honey.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
Well, what d'you know?!
So it wasn't funny, huh? Well, I thought it was. What d'you say, Barney? Wasn't it funny?!
She done moved to Detroit.
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
Guess so.
No. What you usually say, I guess.
I don't know.
Any other family?
Yeah, I been there.
No. I'm new in town.
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
How d'you mean?
What is it?
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
I wouldn't have let you.
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
Why did you?
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
Just for the day?
Yeah. Well, I do.
I'll have some coffee, please.
How about it?
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
You jivin' me?
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
What the hell could you do?
Day work.
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!
Well, that'll be the first time.
Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
'Bye, Jocko.
Yeah. That's right.
Just tryin' to be helpful.
Sorry.
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Good-bye, Duff.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
Hi.
No. Why?
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Okay, boy, beat it.
Since when?
Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
Of course...
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
Excellent, but that's where Peter come in. 3Jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. Peter will simply escort Molly to the villa. Once she's in... Case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode.
Why not?
Very well.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
Dixie McCoy
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
What are you talking about?
Prepping your trip.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
Less than thirty minutes.
The angels... I think they're calling your name.
No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
For Peter, that's a short trip.
What went down between you and Riviera?
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
Uhh, no.
Have you been to any parties?
OUT!
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
I can't do this.
Why is that impossible?
Rob. Please focus.
Rufus?
I love the way she writes.
You remember that story?
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
I'm thinking when I'm home.
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.
Thanks. So do you.
No, I'm alone.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Well, a ball player.
Yeah. Definitely.
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
Yes.
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Oh, please...
Ken!
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
Yeah, why?
Who told you to choke up that way?
That's okay, I wanted to.
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
Uh-uh.  Wait...
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
Making friends?
No.  I'm okay.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
You're going out?
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
I am not going to let you get me into an argument, goddamn it.  Not tonight.  Now get in bed.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
I gotta stay up, Max.
He's close...
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
I don't do that shit.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
I can do that.
Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
Who would know where they were hidden?
No...
What about Kristen?
No.  We're alone.
A sad choice.
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
I'm delighted.
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
And then I... right.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Fifteen million dollars.
Here, let me help.
No.
I brought these, but clearly...
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
I was.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
She left me.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
My son's name is Johnny?
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Okay.
You and every person in this country.
Damn, I forgot the jam.
Jesus.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
What's the thing?
He wouldn't say.
Christ, what is going on in there?
... get fired.
Right. 
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
Shame!
Working with Leonardo.
Di Caprio.
Blimey.  What's that?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Any bit in particular?
Do you ever masturbate?
You see -- it means 'yes.'
I think you do, yes.
That's not fair.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Hi...
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
Yes.
Yes.
Why not?
Just take my work for it.
He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.'  So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
But you have no proof.
No, Miss Ratched...
Would you like to start?
Thank you, ma'am...
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
'K-k-kay, Mack!
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
So long, kid.
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Come here!
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
Through the ass.
Me, too...
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
A pecking party?
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
You heard me the first time!
That's nice. Send me a post card.
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I just started!
Why not?
Gary Blinker...
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
No.
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
You bet, Doc!
I'm afraid not.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
'Kay!
All right!
How much ya wanna bet?
Shhh!  This way!
'Kay...
You's better believe it, brother!
Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
What?
Hi.
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
I don't have any.
Tha's your problem.
Huh?
Yes, ma'am...
He's dead.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
Because.
Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
Yes.
Your great aunt.
Dwayne?
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
Hm.
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
I can hardly hear you.  Could you spell that?
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
If it's any of your business, yes.
Does he love you?
So it wasn't real.
Hi.
Well, good.  Good for you.
You too.
Nice dress.
What are you doing here?
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
Yeah.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
Are you asking me out?
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
I would call it-- unforgivable.
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
Tonight?
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Really...
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
So, what's your point?
It's still the new year...
Because you were afraid to fly.
Does Dwayne know about this?
Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
What?
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
A phone message.  Only--
What's that supposed to mean?...
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
Because I'm the one who's single.
Sure you did.
What?
Good luck.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
So, you've had a little bad luck.
I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
You sure you'll be okay?
What if he doesn't like me?
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
Oh.
Larry, did you rent a car?
A porco?
What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
I thank you.
You miss me?...
Larry, you've got to tell her.
And you didn't tell her?
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
He was always a good kid. You know that.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
He probably gave 'em an argument.
In a minute.
Mmhmm.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Four thirty-seven that isn't where Gerry G...?
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who?  -- who?
None of your business.
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
They play pretty rough.
Which side are you with?
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
I really don't know.
Want to go out and have one with me?
I am?
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
For not being any help?
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
That goes double for me.
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you hadthe only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
I'll find you a priest.
What are you going to do?
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
What do you want from me, Father.
Your gun.
Mind your own business, Father.
You go to hell.
What did you say?
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it  Truth is the gun Drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little   cap pistol.
Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
D 'n D?
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies I'm on borried time.
Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P. 
Boy, you must've been up early.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
Take it easy now, Terry.
Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this  to remember them by.
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
One of these days.
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
A symbol, Master.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
It would seem so, Master
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
Your pleasures of course!
You better hope there is.
I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
I said not as a rule.
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
Tell me, how do you do that?
He didn't want me to.
Why not?
Till they got busted.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Just that she got away.
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
He knows where she lives?
You at least bring the gun?
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
You might not have a choice.
Yeah, I did.
Yeah, hi.  Nice house.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
And then they'll kill 'em.
Is that what you would've done?
All right, but...
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Wait.  You not Adele?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Another C.
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
We're leaving.
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Why, are you famous?
You don't act like it.
We still talk, though.
Sure.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
Think I could have them back?
Unless you wanna tell me.
I just thought maybe you and me could--
Those guys bother you?
What, as a sales rep?
You did?
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
Or once.
It would be worth the risk.
So do you.
He killed a police officer.
Why not?
I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
Outside Adele's.
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
You know.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
So.  What's your point?
I see better with them on.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Of course not.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
How are you, Richard?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
You gonna write me a check?
That time?
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
I don't know.  It's a long way down to Florida.
Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
Jesus, I don't believe it.
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
What's going on, Glenn?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
Gee, I wonder why not.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
It's Richard Ripley.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
Right now, son.
Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this car, man, it's mine.  You go get yourself another one.  I say I'm in on Ripley?  I'm in, with or without <i>your</i> ass.  I say I want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do?
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
What do you want?
No.
Your dog was killed?
What did you call it?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
He's about to.
We don't get to talk much any more.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
No?
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.
You wave back?
It's possible.  Why?
Out for the evening?
That's right, just me.
No.  Course not.
I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
Foley's got it.
You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
That's me, Sir.
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Hale-what?
Land of the free...
Waitress!  Four beers!
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
I got a half a tank.  You?
Little less.
Home of the Brave.
Yeah.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
No baseball diamonds, Red.
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
I want to introduce a couple of people. Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man.  They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's shoes.  In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun.
It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
Charlie...
I call this the staccato. 
Oh yeah?
Maybe I blocked it out.
I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
Yeah. Like that.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
You really love me, don't you?
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Just take a look at it. 
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
You're going to listen to me.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
Of course.
What the hell is that?
Yes, sir. Trust is a twoway street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands.
Of course.
He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
What're you doing here anyway?
Is that one of your poems?
For everyone.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
I can't do that.
I hate chickens.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
Can we split now?
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
I think I'm way ahead of them.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
This morning was good.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
What about?
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
Dancing with you.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
One... two... three.  You are now awake.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
I suppose so.
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
The old Indian burial ground.
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
Charles is right behind me.
I said, don't worry about it.
We're not skipping this treatment.
Whatever.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
No sweat, buddy.
About my blood work?
One week old.
Nine.
Continue.
As in, the vegetable?
Rayisha.
Thank you.
Not bad.
What happens?
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
What impressed you about him?
Except... you were gay?
Yes. On my torso.
What?
Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
Were you recently promoted?
Yes.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Your earrings?
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
It satisfied me.
People who want to bend the rules...
Aren't you?
You're the asshole, buddy.
Not especially.
Lots.
That's perfectly clear.
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Any women on board?
Yes, we did.
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
Beckett?
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
'Mean the whispers?
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
Audrey?
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
Just give me your hand.
But they...they could still be....
Hey, me. Over here.
I assume he licked it clean.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
Thanks for the tip, Johns.
Never said you were a hype, either.
Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
Some prophet guy?
What?
I would rather we all stay--
Rain.
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
So much for my cocktail hour.
Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
Just the same, I want one.
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Geiger counter?
Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
Any particular reason?
Let's find them all.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
I'm prepared to die.
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
Come on. Get me out of here.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
The Hunt Club.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Then you admit --
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
Maybe not.
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Do you believe him?
Yeah. Back about 100 metres. He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place.
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
Over here!
Yeah.
Feelin' good's good enough.
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
You really think so... us?
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam...
...there's nobody.
March man in Tennessee, sniff the pines... sniff that crossmounted pussy walkin' down by the river. What you got Taylor?  Let's see three hundred and WHAT?
Sounds like it.
Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
Vancouver, B.C.
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector.  A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.
What's the matter?
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
Would you mind?
No, please.
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
Dance? Tonight?
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
Us?
From you, I like it.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
I was tried for murdering my husband.  Guilty.  The judge set the verdict aside.  There was one man on the jury--  --but he was afraid.  They were all afraid--of my father-in-law. That man followed me last night-- he came from him of course.  My father-in-law will never give up. Never.  He promised me that.  So I came to Vancouver, B.C. As far away as I can get from North Carolina.  And it happens all over again.  Almost the same thing. Almost the same way.  Do you wonder about this--
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
Killaine...
The best interference runner we've got.  He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman.  Come here, baby.
You leave it.
Wonder what?
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
So that I will never be found.
Mine?
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
It is?
I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
We wouldn't have met at all.
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
Is it a crime?
I don't want to talk.
I've come here to arrest you for murder.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
Morning. Any calls?
This way.
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
For five hundred, what do I get?
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
Got it on you?
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
Round of golf Saturday?
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Could we discuss that some other time?
You'd be breaking the law.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
A little something on account perhaps?
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
I don't think you locked your door.
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
Open it and count it.
Right.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Where's the shell?
Well.  What about it?
Oh nothing.
Positive?
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Four different people, Inspector. Three men and a women.  I've made slides for two.  They handled both envelopes.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
I'll take your word.
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
Aye.  You have a point there.
When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
We'll see you next week, and if--
Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.
I'll suggest it.  Remember though, we're news, not features.  It might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police.  Anyway, I'll be back with this soon. Thanks.
Keep me company.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
A glamorous young lady way above his station...
That's her.
Oh, but he was terrific.
My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.
Who?
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
What did he want?
It's shit.
Let me see.
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
I'm waiting for your mother.
I'm not here.
Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
She said that?
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
I won't.  Goodnight.
Not yet.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
But you're not alone.
I say when it's over!
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Got it...
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
You sure?!
NOOO!!
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!
I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
No way, old buddy.
Who's our back-up on this?
This gets better by the minute.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
That rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles, at most! We're almost home. But the chopper won't wait.
You know you can't win this one.
We both got scores to settle.
I saw it.
The best friend I ever had.
We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
He's not really my uncle.
But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
Hope to be?
Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished.  You've won.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
Yes.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Fair enough.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
Just a romantic, that's you.
No hurry.  Would you like some breakfast?
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
"Occupational hazard".
What are assets?
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
Don't drown.
What?
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Please.
No.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
What if someone tries to steal it?
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
What do you mean?
Business.
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
I'll bring it back.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
No one you know.
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
Yes.
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
Yeah.  I just got it.
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a "B."  Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see.
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
I... Edward...
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
I'm just looking, thanks.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
It's very expensive.
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
Should I be?
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
What?
I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
Yes, some of the time. 
Have you any money?
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
What is it?
Okay.
No.  To the pain.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Shall we track them both?
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
There we cannot help you.
-- power too -- promise me that --
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
Begin!
And what is that?
I ought to be after twenty years.
Okay.
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
Good. Then pour the wine.
I smell nothing.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
Then make your choice.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
Yeah, an hour.
It would take a miracle. Bye!
Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody.
Let's hear him.  What have we got to lose?  What's your name?
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. 
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
But that's cheating!
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
One night.
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
Maybe you're happy.
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
No way out.  No way out.
I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.
Double.  Double.  Double.
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Vat about it?
Really, I never dreamed ...
I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
Nice girl.
Get car.  Get car.
We can't play today?
I shall count the minutes.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Ta.  Ta.
Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
Wagner...
Bismark...
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
People can hear you.
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
I mean in show business.
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
Tell me all about her.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
How do you know she didn't make a call?
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
Cash or check? For the cabin...
Cash.
My mother.
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
Who are you, friend?
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
What difference does that...
Where?
What's the matter?
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
What thing could we be in together?
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
Where... can I stay?
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Sam, I'm going.
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
In a hurry.
Yes. I think he would have.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
You go out... with friends?
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
To a private island, like you?
It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
Well? You meant well?  People always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that...
Phoenix?
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
Is there?
Please.
Have you two had breakfast?
I suppose you want a cabin.
And now that your mother's dead?
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
Indeed, he has often told me.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
Dr. Meirschultz, too?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
He isn't here.
No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
There's no child here.
No!  Good night!
The blood transfusion is completed. While Marc himself is looking after the patient, the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room, where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage. The doctor stands bending over Lone.
In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
I don't agree with you.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
I won't let you say that!
Thank you.
But it was really my fault.
I'd love to.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
The body of Joan Gale!
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
Meaning what?
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
I'm going to make you eat dirt, you soap bubble! I'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go!
I don't remember. Not so very far--
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Cry-baby?
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ... 
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
You're insane.
You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
Okay.
I could go out of town.
A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
Buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, I don't want to talk to you. I'm going out and sweep the patio.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
You were pretty bad, huh?
What did you expect?
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as I've been please have pity on me and don't ruin me by telling them what I did. I know it was bad, it was bad and dumb. But mostly it was dumb, I didn't mean you no harm, I'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that's the truth. I love you. But they'd think I did, they'd think I was awful, they'd despise me and hate me...
I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas.
Okay.
All right, what do you know?
Yeah, he's still up there.
True, but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder. Now let's go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with.
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Yeah.
He kissed her.
Here comes Daddy.
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
Yes, we know her.
What?
You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
You're not having lunch?
She will succeed.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
Quarter of twelve.
I don't see any bruises or broken bones.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!
She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.
Yes, sir.
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
I'm not hungry.
Yes, sir.
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
Yes, sir.
You mean a farm?
Your baby?
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.
Oh, to hell with it, never mind. Don't tell her anything. Don't even tell her you saw me.  Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my plane.
I'm only trying to help him, Mother.
She looks terrible, just awful.
Afraid of the hospital?
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
Illusions, Madam?
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Yes, Ma'am.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
I had better call Daddy.
Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna kill me.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
That's them trying to kill us.
Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
Oh.  Well.   I think it's pretty common knowledge that in the Battle of Little Big Horn, Custer was drunk off his ass.
Maybe.
There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
Yes, sir.
Well, sir...
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
Murderer?  Really?
Slow down.
Come again... ?
Seatbelts fastened, please.
Good.  Thought I was imagining them.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
Yes, my Master.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
The same as always.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
We got separated.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Vader is here...now, on this moon.
Your father?
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
If that is your destiny.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Janet.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
Janet
Yes.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
So come up to the Lab.
Smile and that will mean I may
Wheeling
No no no no.
And our World will do the Time Warp again.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
Why?
It's only temporary.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
The glasses... Please.
Don't tease me.
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
Yes.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
...Are you going to say anything to him?
Yeah...
...I can't beat him.
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
...Like you?
Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance.
Get outta my life both of ya's.
Owe you what?
Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me.
What?!
You's the novelty, Champ!
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
No, man, it's very smart.
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
...Ten minutes.
Cost ya a buck.
Creed is down!!!
What's happenin' here?
I'm happenin'! This pig is takin' my shot -- I iz a contender. He's nothin'.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
It don't matter. It's my reputation. These guys think they can get off light. It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business. See ya killer.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
You think I don't hear things?
A few bucks.
No action.
Stuff it, man!
Makes your breath like garbage.
Why?
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Message -- What message?
...Shrewd.
See how fast he is -- damn!
Yo, can I have my locker back?
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Creed's great.
Bullmastiff.
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess. 
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Maybe ya better forget it.
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
I thought I was doin' ya a favor -- C'mon inside -- Y'know, my sister really likes ya.
What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
Oh, no...
I'll bet.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
Why didn't you tell me?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Maybe.  Why?
Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
No, it's not.
I think you oughta read it to her.
Good idea.
Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
Am I like Such a fellow?
Of love?
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
Welcome.
O God!--O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? What sayest thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort nurse.
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
You kiss by the book.
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
If my heart's dear love--
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Pink for flower.
A Plague o' both your houses.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
That's him.
Once.
That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
I think not.  After you...
What do you mean?
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
In here...
You'll die if you leave here.
I sent it to myself in Paris.
It's done.
Then I guess we're set.
Don't cross me...
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.  The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival.
Eat shit and die slowly...
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
I do.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
Like Larry or Swede.
I just wanted to see something.
A lot of people died.
It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now.  He's going to Paris.  Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there.
And what job is that?
Thorough man.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
In a minute.
Would you stop with that...
What?
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
Doing well.  This is?
Sure thing, and --
Seven thousand...
There must be over a million dollars in here.
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
He would have done it to us, right?
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
I want my share. All of it.
Just take it in stride.
Heard you had quite a night.
Nothing's wrong.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
I love you Sally.
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
Yeah, it is...
Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
We appreciate that.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Have I seen her?
Sure.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
I didn't say that.  You did.
Just do it!  Meet me there, now.
Listen -
You're never getting that much.
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
So someone did get away.
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
No, I just assumed...
Two-hundred thousand!
I'd like to see you try.
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
I don't think so.
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
I knew you were lying.
I'm sorry.
No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
This is a very dangerous man.
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
Ask me if I give a shit.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
Gimme the binoculars.
It's a bomb.
No.
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
It's worth it to me.
The Plaza Hotel?
Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
Why don't you go get them?
No.  But I'll help you.
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
Yes, Master.
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
He was just doing his job.
So was I.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Witnesses.
I know a shortcut.
Did you make the plate?!
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Don't go there...
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.
Going into the restaurant.
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
Where'd you get it?
What's wrong with that?
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
At this point we don't have much.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
What?!
Nobody touches me.
Ambassador Han.
Griffin?  Where are you.
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
Good one!  Thanks.
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
Really?
A pre-wedding luau?
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Maybe someday.
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
No.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
No.  You take it.
Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
Lost!
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
Yes.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Good boy, Port Hole.
No, you tell her.
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
Does it have wheat in it?
I don't think so.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
I do.
It was my mother's.
About what?
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
Good night.
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
Made for each other.
No, I'm not. 
I love the symphony.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Go home for the weekend.
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
The one in the street.  I chased after you.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
No.
What's she talking about?
It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
But how am I going to get there?
Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
I'm starting to forget her.
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.
What's wrong with Annie?
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
If I didn't go.
No.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
Well...
"An Affair To Remember." Did you ever see it? Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.  Before that it was called "Love Affair With Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
The woman question?
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Who? A scab?
They are singing for me.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
Never... never... never!
They say I am no good to you.
The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
Can be what?
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
Forgot what?
You've got to help around the house!
Ramn ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Yeah.

They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
Did you see his hair color?
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Go ahead.
You get off on abuse or something?
What happened to your eye?
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
I just can't. Okay?
I don't want to leave you.
Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive.
Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
Twelve
Sorry.
I find myself in dire need of some cash.
Can you set that up?
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
When? When did you ever see me use?
I can't tell you.
No, I'm good.
Why do you say that?
Uh-uh-uh ...
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
This chink have a name?
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
The Mexicali Boys
He's the only one I told.
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
What do you mean?
Look at that place. It's creepy.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
That is so unfair.
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Casualties?
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
Not where I come from.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
White-walls?
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
You think the rest of us were?
I don't expect to live that long.
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
The men said, nine.
Those guns are close.
Somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the Hundred-and-First's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works.  We're going in blind.
Uh, Captain...
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Three for three.
Yup, hell of a mission.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Vecchio.
I'll do my best.
Yes, sir.
What are we going to do?
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
But we accomplish the mission.
That's a mystery to me.
You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
See to it.
Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
Understanding the following rights...
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
What's a scam?
Going out as friends.
Please?
Yes.
See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
Meaning?
Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Now why can't I tell the story?
Dad, why are you acting this way?  Is this because of the other morning?
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
I'm so ashamed dad.
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Eight.
No.
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
Bye.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Yeah.
Oh.  I was putting the...
Yeah.
I don't think so.
It was wonderful.
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
No, I don't, I don't.
No.
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
I love you.  Please, I love you.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
The truck?
Well, we pay for the [?].  That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.
I'm totally and completely serious.
I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something.  I'm going to give you another chance.  Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening.  Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
Just her name.
So what's up?
Lloyd.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
How you doin', brother?
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
I love you too.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Now you're back.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
Klaus Tauber.
A charade?  How could it be a charade?
It's a beautiful city.
I'm sorry to hear that.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
It's bad business.
Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
He's important to my business.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
Yeah, I can.
What other point is -
Stern.
You'll lose money.
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
Don't. Think Bailey.
Who is this?
Do I know you? You look familiar.
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Why don't you ask them?
Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise.
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Yeah?
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
Yeah, right.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
That's not the way we play the game.
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
Oh my God.
The safety what? Fuck that!
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
Yeah, right.
I counted four.
You're not allowed to ask that.
I just love being a sister.
But she's standing right next to you.
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
Do you work for her now?
Who is this?
Asshole, Can't talk.
Thanks.
More of a game really.
Good bye Ben.
Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
There's more.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
Follow me.
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Sid I can see you!
DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
Why would the police come to you?
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Are you saying she was-
I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.
Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards.
Who's this?
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
Roman that's not the line.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
I'm sorry, your voice.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
No...
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
Oh Sidney...
Or even a good porno.
Yeah... I think so.
I called my dad.
Uh-huh.
You don't still think it was me?
Who are you trying to reach?
It happens. Take it easy.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
Really? What?
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
I told you not to hang up on me.
I believe you...
So you better leave.
Guess.
No...
YES!
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
Shit.
I don't know. I guess.
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
He's her boyfriend.
How is she?
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Yes, sir.
Call the police.
Just stay back.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
Do you still think he's innocent?
And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
Your front porch.
What am I doing?
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
...so call if you need me.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
Before she dumped him for Steve.
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Wanna another beer?
Are you serious?
How do you gut someone?
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Whatever. Just hurry.
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
So far it's all dead ends.  No credit history.  No employment history.  His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash.  We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane.  We may never know how he got that way.
Ease back, Mills.
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
Really?
I read about it in the paper.
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
Why?
NO!
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
You should be thanking me.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
I realize that.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
Hello.
What about them?
I read.  Remember reading?
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
Forced what?
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
I wish I still thought like you.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.
Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
Satisfy our curiosity?
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
I don't know... like fifty.
Him?
I don't.  Neither do you.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
Where's the victory?
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
Kiss me on the lips.
Really?
He mentioned it.
I want to have children.  It's just...
When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.
How should I know?
What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress...  I found Lucy back there in that canyon...I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...I thought it best to keep it from you -- long as I could.
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
No sir...pleasure.
Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
How many, would you say?
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
I'm Clayton.
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
Good night.
You all settled an' comfortable now?
Think she means for us to follow?
Ain't that too bad...If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours...
You've seen her!...She's alive?
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
Dear Miss Laury...I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Com- anches the late Mister Futterman told us about...
We got two around that age...
It still worked in town.
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
What?
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
I've killed my husband!
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
Thank you, Ned.
I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.
Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child.
Tomorrow.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
Romeo
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
A goodly length in times past, but lately
On my mother's side the Ardens
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
Who wrote that?
No, then.
Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
Go on.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
Do you think?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
"Out of her favour where I am in love."
It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Like Valentine and Silvia?
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
And I love poetry above all.
"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
You can bring them with a word.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
I am.
Even your play.
Moonlight!
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
Then I will go with you.
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
Write me well.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
It was your eyes. No, your lips.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Wait there.
Of course you have not! I have not written it!
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
A man, my lord?
Why, thank you, David.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
Take his legs.
But not quite.
Now.
You're sure? There's lots more.
You're not eating.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?
I don't know anything about it.
What?
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Yeah.
So I gathered.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
What? What's wrong?
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
And now you tell me.
OK.
Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
Who was it?
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
He can't stay up there.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
I refuse.
No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
What?
Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
You were going to say something.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
No, nothing, sorry.
No, three. Who said there were four?
You're sure of that.
That wasn't a question.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Yes. They're my friends.
I'm sorry.
Two hundred pounds?
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
But they sneer, don't they?
Yes, sir.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
A certain weakness.
I suppose so.
No.
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
What do you expect me to do about it?
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
-- think what you have time to think, Lester.
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
I don't know.
I don't want to see you anymore.
Calm down, baby.
I don't want to place you in any position --
Why don't you see Lester?
What about?
I hope she's all right.
Well she...
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
Okay.
Am I what?
No kidding.
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
How is she?
She is.
I went to school with her husband.
You do know what money's like these days.
Well, yeah... you know.
You promised you'd do the show.
Oh fuck, Norman!
You do it.
-- Yeah... your car down here?
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
I'd cut it...
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
Did Lester know about him?
I don't want to... I swear...
Sit down!
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
-- what guy?
-- this guy with Jill.
Sweetheart, you're drunk.
-- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
Jackie, can we --
Sammy's?
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
-- sure.
-- oh I thought you were --
-- ass and legs --
Not me, pal.
-- we are?
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
I can't just let him stand by the door...
-- Right after I sprayed her?
Otis is dead.
-- you know better...
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Okay... thanks...
Now, George --
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
You've never even been around one.
Okay, baby. Okay...
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Could I talk to you for a second?
Could I?
Egypt.
No, but I think they might.
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
-- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
Bullshit.
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
I'd like you to leave now.
How many?
I just want to know, that's all.
How?
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
-- yes.
You need a cut.
Well, baby, I'm George and it needs to be cut.  But I don't want to place you in that position either.
Well, yeah.
So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.
Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
Oh yeah?
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
All night.
What do they look like?...
Sit down.
Oh Jesus Christ.
Did they have something against me?
Me!
I mean, how did that happen?
She's nothing but a whore.
I'm finished with her.
I'll call you back.
Okay, okay...
I'll call you back.
Okay.
I was too old.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
George is going to open a shop.
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
Fine.
You ought to get rid of those dogs.
Does she know about us?
That's right.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
I'm exaggerating.
C'mon.
Well, there was this one time --
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
Sure.
Let's do that.
You're going.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
Jill.
Jill.
Thank you.
Are you married?
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
I can't.  I have too much to do.
Dad?
I guess so.
Good.  I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
All right.
Okay...oh!
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Advocaat is it?
And, er... where are they now?
Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
Sound good to you, Danny?
Pleased to meet you.
Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
I guess we've been staying up too late.
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
Good.
Jack...
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!
Give me the bat.
Oh, it sure would be
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
Fine.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
Went shopping. Why?
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
Sure.
Will you do it?
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
I will- be good, kids.
What you say?
You know, I just might!
YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it off.
You did what?
You bastard!
Thanks.  A lot.
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
Right.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Just about.  Show me again.
That man -- who is he?
It's true -- I know her.
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
She won't?  Why not?
Experience!  Right?
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
A what?
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
What's wrong with my life?
Mary Clarence!
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
What?
I must go where I can be of use.
But...
Oh?
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Get a stenographer.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
I am?
Really?  Lieutenant?
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
Take care of it.
You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.
Not... totally.
Which one!
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
Yes?
I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence?
Really...
Christy.
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
Excuse me?
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
They need guidance.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
Hmm?  See them?
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning.
No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
I hear nothing.
What happened?
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
Did your father take a loan?
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
You made this, and the drawings?
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
She is not your birth mother, is she?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
I apologize if I worried you.
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
The skull is gone.
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
I do not know.  Away.
No.  She has gone out.
You are from the Hollow?
In a way, yes.
Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon.  But... I am not going to kill you.  Not me...
You got any money?
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
Well, what did you want?
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
That might be better than this.
What do you want, hun?
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
They let you out?
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
Were they bad people?
Maybe they needed it.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
I like the way you talk.
Where'd you get them flowers?
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
You're strong though. You let me make them touchdowns so I'd feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
I ain't got no boy.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
Yes sir.
Do they know about you?
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
Yes ma'am.
I believe you. I really do.
He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.
How long have you been standing here?
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
What about me?
No, we have to get this story.
Why won't he talk to women?
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
An invitation?
It's my birthday.
What's that, Sol?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
It's yours?
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
I'm all ears.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
Eighteen and a half years.
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
Why don't you open it and find out?
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
Huh?
What can I do for you?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
I figured he had a right to know.
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
Eight-thirty?
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
How long have you been here?
Two or three nights.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
Where the hell do you think you're going?
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
What time did you get to bed last night?
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
Is it yours?
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
It wasn't my fault.
He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.
Medium rare, please.
Fries?
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
Oh, yeh?
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
You don't.
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
And the next one...?
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Tht was summation, Your H...
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Yes.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
You're wondering why I held it.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
I think you like learning.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.
For the third time, yes.
Carl never lied.
Yes.  And that one, too.
Clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
Fresh!
Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory.
A what?
Hey, she's ticklish!
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
Hey, Joe!
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
With you.
With me?
Josephine and Geraldine!  Come on!
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
You don't see any blood?
As far away as possible.
Shave our legs, stupid.
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
And I'm not even pretty.
Blow where?
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
This happens to me all the time in public.
You can both go take a flying jump.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
What?
Sugar?
Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
That's all right.  I was afraid it was Sweet Sue. You won't tell anybody, will you?
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
No, no.
I have a very low resistance.
We better have a drink first.
What's that?
Come on, Daphne.
Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
I met one of them.
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
What for?
I always did.
The Florida job?
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
Because I got some plans -
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
The instruments are right, but you are not.  I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
I play the ukulele.  And I sing too.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Afford it?
Rough?
Yeah.
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Would you mind terribly?
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
I don't think so.
I wish you'd make sure.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Not very likely.
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
Well, I'm not.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
- riding to hounds -
What theory?
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
You collect shells?
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
Three?
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Harmless - how?
Complete washout.
I don't want to bore you.
Oh, no!
Talk about sad.
What is it?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
It's like smoking without inhaling.
Let's make it an even million.
Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Some people got no respect for the dead.
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
I never join nothin'.
Toothpick Charlie?  Never heard of him.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
You and who else?
Refresh my memory.
Why wouldn't I?
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!
But I do. I will. Youre my sister.
Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, youre my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because youve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldnt outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesnt feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I dont know, but your misery just isnt working for me anymore.
What for?
Im not as square as my daughter thinks.
Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
You are taking the piss?
I had to say something to get you here.
Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
No, thats not it.
Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Nothing, nothing.
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
I dont do naked. My sister? She does naked.
A wedding.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Yeah.
I have to.  Im the best man.
You have more than one gynecologist?
I wasnt saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
Its complicated, Dad.
You don't live around here, do you?
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
I try...
What he talk 'bout?
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
Yes, Miss Johnson...
Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
I did look, Charlie, but I--
Yeah. We better git back to house now.
Yes, sir...
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
What happened afta that?
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
My father taught me...
Yes, David...
Listen, Mama...
He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
I don't know a damn thing, now stop bothering me about it!
Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
They probly thought you was crazy.
He said, I don't know, Ike -- you doin' better'n me, I been tryin' to git in there for 200 years and ain't make it yet!
At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
Is there something I can do to help you?
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
Alright, now I want you to say 'horsefucker.'
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
I hate the environment.
Fragile?
I said -
What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
But what are we going to do against this entire army?
I saw him last night!
Okay.
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Oh.
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
Your behind?
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
What the hell are you guys doing here?
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
Eric?
Something big, children.
How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles?
What?
MPH RM!!!
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
A deal? You wanna make a deal with the devil. Well sure, deals are mounds o' fun.
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
Yeah, I guess.
Kay.
We can't leave without you!
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
Our moms suck!
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Totally!
Yeah, they suck.
I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>
Me?!
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
What about air strikes?
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
Alright, I'll make the call...
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
You don't care.
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
No! It can't be!
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Uh...
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now.  I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do-right... motherfuckers!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
I don't know.
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
Hopefully sooner than later.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Mac.  What's shaking?
One moment please...  one moment please...
What kind of man?
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
The pin machine?
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
What do you want with old man Faz?
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.
No kiddin'.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
Think he bought it?
Theo.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
That game was before you was born.
I ain't nobody's father!
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
I didn't think so.
You're a scumbag.
I never saw you.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
Junior.
Junior who?
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
Mine, and they never tip.
Do you have a girlfriend?
No. Not at the present.
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
No, I'm fascinated.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
Can I come with you?
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
Suck my dick!
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
Get out of there!
Would you wait a minute?
Nobody move!
Fifty yards and closing.
He's right beneath us.
Anything else?
-- Wait a second --
Hold on --
I don't know.  That's the point.
How drastic?
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
When was this?
At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring.
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
In a minute, sir.
Yes, Harry.
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
He understands me fine.
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
Resetting the sub.
What -- are you threatening me?
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
You went through Edmunds' things?
I don't trust Harry to do it.
Still clear.
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
The refridgerator.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
I don't know.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Parasolutrine?
Where are you?
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You know what I mean.
Do you fear them?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
But --
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
I promise --
Beth --
It's either this... or I kill you.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
Top shelf, is it?
What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
You'd have to ask them.
Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
Just in time for what?
Another attack?
Like what?  I'm not --
You're staring at me.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
I'm not being defensive.
Whatever I can do to help.
So what?
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
Did I?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
But why would she -- ?
Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
Well, press something!
You mean forget?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
Who's everyone?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
Four.  Four years --
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
Who's going to pay me then?
I'm not going out there.
Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.
My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
What do I do?
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
I'm not going alone!
Was this trip really necessary?
Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
What are you saying?
Don't you believe it.
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
Are you safe?
Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
Death to all bugs !
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
So ?
A funeral.
Yeah.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Zander, no...!
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
I'll go for that.
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
You don't look very happy to see me.
We've gotta go get her !
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Thank you, ma'am.
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
Hut... hut !
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
Sir, yes, sir !
Uh, no.
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Who's that with you ?
Yes, sir !
We're not leaving you here, sir !
Who is V'ger?
<U>Answer</U>!
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
May I ask Why?
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
It's taken control of the computer...!
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
Aye, sir.
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
I quit the movie.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
It's...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
"Room Service!"
Would you go in...
You have to sign for it.
One moment.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
The other side.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
I used to go out with a politician.
How about, he sees her on the street, he wipes the soot from his eyes.  He goes up to her.  "What happened to the horse?" She looks at him.  She takes his hand...
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
That's right...
...take <u>any</u> two people...
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
Is it...
...what...?
Not without a rolltop desk.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
I've been thinking.
I have to tell you something...
I wasn't doing business.
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
Hi.
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
And a <u>fantasy</u> object...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
I don't eat vegetables.

Page...<u>three</u>.  Now:  "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
Mr. Bailey.
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
<u>You</u> know...Where's your bathroom?
Look, look there's someone else...
I...
Claire, Bob Bar...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
Yes, yes, but...
We, we have to give it.
An artist of your caliber...
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
She won't stop crying...
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
This young woman.
He told you that...
Later for you, pal.
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
Mmmm.  You have children?
My wife just went into labor...
He saw the girl in the car...
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
I can only write on a manual.
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
That's what I said.
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
Sherry, Sherry...
It takes all kinds.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
Then I can't do this shot...you wants me to push in--I can't push in through the window...We go back to New Hampshire?
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you <u>are</u> in the purple family.
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
...why do you think?
Because it feels really incredibly good.
What are you gonna talk about?
Like a big sister.
You have to ignore him.
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
You lost Ben?!
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
No.
Then have a donut --
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
Yes...if you like big hair...
What honey?
Mom...?
Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
How do you know?
I helped.
Half.  Of him.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
Not to me.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
A lot smaller.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
But it's not on the schedule!
You got to hell!
I need practice.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
We can't live like that.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
Yeh, it's cheaper.
Jesus.
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
What's eight, ten years?  Hell, you'll still be ambulatory.  I think.
Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
Well, they will be.
I needed some time away.
Restless.
And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined.
Nice to have you here.
It was God's will.
No.
No, Mikey.
No.
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
But still, you can't be sure.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
No, you don't.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
What's tomorrow?
Huh?
Oh. What happens now?
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
What are you doing here?
Thanks.
Say, Ni...
...gger.
Again!
Hello, is this Pam?
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
That's good. So then what do you do now?
Eight, six, and four.
I know.
No, I don't think so...
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
Oh.
I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
What happened?
By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
There's the fence...
You're talking about committing suicide!
Where does it lead?
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
I'll let the senator tell you.
What do you mean?
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
Get your men to do it!
Moffo!
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
That's right, fella.
What?
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
What is your name, young lady?
Yes!  Who the hell is this?
I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
What kind of trouble?
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
Yes, sir.
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
And lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded.  They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. Air Police will have lists of all owners.
I know that, sir.
You're damned right they are.
Just a squirt.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I see.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Peace on earth.
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Roger. One-three-eight.
War.
Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
I think they mean business.
Hang on, boys.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Primary trigger switch.
Why should they call us back?
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
How long were you in there?
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
Was it okay?
Your a nurse?
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Do you wanna go to the van?
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
The dude wants it.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
No, no.
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
What, they're looking for her?
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Tim...
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Am I fucking him?
Shit.
I'm so burnt-out.
You better! Yes!
Glad it's okay.
I just started it.
Hey, thanks, man.
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
Yeah!
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
What about me? I don't have a car.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
I'm sorry.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Oh, wow.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
He's drunk.
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
No.
Nazeer Chaudry!
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
Okay. Okay, look my wife called the police. They're coming. It's not too late. They'll come, they'll take care of her. I'm going inside.
I know, I know, I know.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
It's a piece.
So you can give me more shit?
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
How?
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
No, I don't.
No. No, no, no.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
Oh, yeah?
Where are you going?
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Oh, fuck it, man!
So how's college?
Really?
No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
I don't know.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
Oh!
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
You do not!
Yeah?
Oh, no, man. I can't.
I'm moving.
Oh, my god!
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
About what?
What are you going to do? Hm?
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.
Fucking drunk, huh?
It's twins!!
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
And they get caught!
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
That was gas, Sweetie.
We were told you could "fix us up."
He Ikea'd us.
Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
Thanks!  That'd be great.
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
You damn well better...
Maybe we can make a deal.
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
Why, you sweet kid.
Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
As for instance?
You'll be waiting for me?
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
I was afraid of that.
I tell you this is half sold.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
Nice job.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
It must be my new shampoo.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
I just don't.
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
Gordon Cole?
It's a good script, isn't it?
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
Fair enough.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
You'll need them for parties. You'll need them for New Year's Eve.  Where are your evening clothes?
The other guests?
You think this is all very funny.
Great stars have great pride.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
Where are your...?
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
Good.
Why do you say that?
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
No?
Gillis, get this through your head.  I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent.  I'm your friend.
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
Had he been trying to blackmail you?
You know better than to interrupt me.
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
Miss what?
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
Well thanks a pile, fella.
Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
Come back to my house. My car's outside.
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Supergirl?
What about my proposal?
Theories?
Oh, sure.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
Can you create life?
You're not...an orphan are you?
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
Cigarette?
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
Nonsense.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
No, that's not true---there's well...no--
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
Zaltar!
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
I seem to be.
The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
Clark.
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
Oh?
What's that?
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
Say what?
Uh...
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Stone mutha.
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
No...I just have a little stop to make.
Sister! I'm his sister!
What she call you?
And do what?
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Diet soda?
Turn on the light.
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
It could make weather!
Storms! Floods!
We already have a super-tanker.
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
We can get to work on that oil!
Who needs Gus?
Don't bet on it!
Hostages?
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Maybe I could try --
Superman? Oh, was he here?
Whoever, I  Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
Uh...home...
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
What's a curl?
Now This I want to hear.
No possibility for parole?
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
Dinner. Oh yes.  I'm sorry, I just never do much about that.  But tonight -- I mean, anything you want, Lois.
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
He ran in fear from us . . .
It will. Starting with your own.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
Don't worry, I've got you.
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
But why the hair?
That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
You're just an experiment, freako!
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
Shut up, apple-polisher.
We're running out of smoke.
Albert!
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
A hot story, huh?
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
Oh.
Come again?
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
Ready.
Tea?
You got wax in your ears?
Lex is going bye-bye.
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
He will be odd, different.
Twenty-four.
Okay, but...why?  No offense.
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Sure.
Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
Otis...
It is for me.
Of time, Luthor.
In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
We'll see how fast I can fly.
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
But you said...
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
She's resting.  In her room.
How?
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
Billy, that's too early.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
Good night.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
Berry-picking.
And what's that?
That's right.
Did they give him special care?
He knows that?  Billy?
Billy said that?
Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
Away from your crazy Mom.
From you?
That's what he said.
Oh.
Yes.
Yes.
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
When?
That's the local bar?
There's the Prescots...
Tell me about it.
Is this it?
Yes.
Welcome to hard times, Daddy.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
Do you like the colour?
Nothing.
Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
Is "he" inside?
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Serious as a deacon...I like it.  I like your style, son!  In a world of old rags and bones, I like it! For instance, take Sidney.
Wait a minute, I haven't handed over punishing privileges to you YET!  Put the whip down and I might respect what you're saying...
Why?
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...
She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
Not just this minute, J.J....
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
The day that I can't get along without press agents' handouts, I'll close up shop, lock, stock and barrel and move to Alaska.
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
Get Steve back his job...please...
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
Wild?  Take a look at them and see who's wild...
Susie, there's nothing wrong with Dallas!  Your brother and I arranged it all. And if the Leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life, forget it! - your brother arranged that one, too!  I don't usually give away presents; but this is my gift to you: Get out of here!  Leave this man!
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
But what?
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
Nothing...
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
Did you now?  On which bounce?
You tell him, I stutter!
What ship?
I didn't do anything!
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
Let me try mine.
My mission is to protect you.
Yeah?  Who sent you?
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Right.
What?
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
No.
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
I have to go away, John.
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
No shit?
I love you, John.  I always have.
Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
Yes.
Our duty is to help Furtwngler with his defence,  That's why I want you to look at this...  These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't get them translated fast enough. But I guess you understand German, right?
Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
Yes.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
Colonel. Pleasure.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
Your mother, too.
What is this, Emmi?
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
Who?
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
Von der Null?
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
Yes, that's what happened.
But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
So. You wanted to see me.
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
He did?
One of your people told me.
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
The Miracle Kid.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Right. Claims assessor.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
I won't let the fat kid down.
I'll do the same for you sometime.
What's it to ya?
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
That's the way it was told to me.
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
Not possible.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
Someone?
No.  Never.
Oh, Kyle.
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
Okay.
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
Projections were far too optimistic.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
Clean out your locker.
Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner.  I get a note...
A game?
No.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
That one did.
Then, what good are you?
What?
Scams, con games.  How many?
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
What do we do?
It's out of your hands.
I'm back from the dead.
They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
... what... ?
Fuck you.
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Stop talking to them!
Stop talking...
Let me show you...
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Originally, Connecticut.
One brother, one sister.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
That's why it's a classic.  Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
Fun?
What?  Connie...
Split it?
Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
Oh... it's a game.
We provide whatever's lacking.
First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.  Second, you don't have to decide today.  Take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  One day, the game begins.  You either love it or hate it.  Decide then.  We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  That was my sales pitch.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Guess!
No, you didn't...
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
His behavior... ?
Look, where is he?!
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
Greetings fellow sheep counter.
It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
I've read your tests.
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
No.
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
All night?
Yeah.
Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
It was very specific.
I got more scared.
No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something.
It was a stupid thing to do.
It was.
Welcome Home.
You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?
It's okay... we're all here...
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
So far.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
No.
You're okay.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Not for you, clearly.
What kind of food?
I'm sorry.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
We'll find him.
Fuck you.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
This ain't your lot?
Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing <u>them</u>.  Checking <u>them</u> out.  I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
What?
He's gotta know why.
Didn't get it.
Well, those are the breaks.
She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
No, why did you come here?
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Weren't you on a television series?
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't.
That's what was estimated.
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
My employer.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Could do, yeah.
Which kind?
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
The L.A.P.D.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
What?
Like what.
I don't get it.
How we gonna get that lucky?
Jennifer Wilson.
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
Is he here?
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
Be seein' you.
The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
Yeah. Thanks.
Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.
We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry.
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
Huh.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
Did she make mistakes?
I'll have it in a week.
Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well...
Maybe.
You're out of line, mister.
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
Mm.
Uh-huh.
What is it, Dave?
Uh-huh.
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
Mm.
Congratulations, Gina.
I don't know. I don't think so.
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
Yeah.
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
So... who... who actually--
...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
No thanks, honey.
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Yeah, yeah--go home.
Whuddya mean?
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
OK.
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
That's very generous.
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
Crane. Ed Crane.
Uh... you're under arrest.
No.
Anything missin'?
Just a minute.  I'm shaking!  Take the gun.
Oh Jesus...
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Where's the head?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
You've been holding out on me Pendergast.  You have a suspect capable of this?
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
Let me see the plant press.
They're eggs.
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
You're color blind.
Keep the light up.  I can't see.
Quiet.
What?
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
What kind of hormones?
So what?
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
I don't know.
They're all heavily armed.
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
Oh God!  Help!
Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with master videographer, Christof.
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
I'm the creator.
The memory of who?
You think she'd go through with it?
<i>Spare room</i> - I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird.  I'm going, don't you worry about that.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
How about them?
What exactly?
I won't be late.
Every time you and Marlon--
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
Oh, my God!
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
That's not true.
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
You're part of this, aren't you?!
--Truman, you're gonna be late!
How's your hip?
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.
The whole area's being evacuated.
There's no one here.
Were you there--how do you know?
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
Sorry. Don't have one.
Evidence of what?
Yes.
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
Kurtzweil, we think.
What's that?
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
That's what I'm saying.
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
You're looking for a bomb.
Where are you, Mulder?
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
I can't really talk right now.
Evidence of a massive infection.
What kind of infection?
Mulder --
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
What did you find?
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
It may be extraterrestrial.
I have no idea.
Yeah...?
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
No -- it's --
She was with me.
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.  Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children,  The only future any of us have.
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
Where is he?
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
What about you?
I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
That's my girl.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
Do you think that's funny?
Peter, okay?
You think you can do this, don't you?
Tell me.
So you say.
That hoist, with the winch...
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
Any psychiatric medication?
What about the cat?
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
Das worren nooh zeiten.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
He was Harry's driver?
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
Why don't you leave this town - go home?
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
Silly looking bunch.
Just another part I've got to learn.
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
Well you read this.
What's that?
Tell you what?
Where is she?
I thought you wanted...
Wait here.
A parrot...Let it go.
I'll put these flowers in water.
Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
That's the reason.
We loved each other, do you mean that?
Where's Harry?
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
Martins.
Once in a while.
It wasn't petrol.
Calloway.
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
Which side of the road?
Win what?
No, a major, were you really?
Goodness, that's awkward.
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Never heard of him.
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
In great pain?
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
I was told that he did not die at once.
Yes.
And?
No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue.
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
I don't think so.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
We're ok.
What happened?
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
You can swim?
Incredible.
Exactly.
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint.  Give it to me.
Yes.
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
I don't care about money.
You will.
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Then how come you're talking to me?
Why won't you talk to me?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...
Oh, yeah... 
Fuck that.
I told you, I'm good at this.
Lina, come here!
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
Nothing. Let's go....
Did you see how they reacted to him?
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
Obviously.
I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to -- 
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
What were you, following me?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
Who killed Manzetti?
Get the fuck away from me.
Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
No!
It's German.
Fine.
We want to talk to you about something....  We're about to launch an aboveground, intellectually serious fascist movement.
That's meat.
Steve's going to explain it.
It will.
Exactly.
No.
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
Just a little... What's the difference?
Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
What?
Johana, am I boring you?
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
The documents are forged.
Hello!
The Mamma's there too.
Six seconds.
Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
The rules are the rules.
... What's your name again?
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
And... does the voice come back?
That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...
Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good".  I lost my title but I won a watch!
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
You say that because you have the title!
Well that's very nice of you.
... The way she moves.
Uh... Yes, of course!
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
It's me... Johana.
You'll try again tomorrow?
You go back, I'll walk.
You want to lie down for a while?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
You are the father.
Ah?!
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
I'm going to put a lock on the telephone.  Did you bring the cassettes?
... Sally?
They got the new T.V.
You called the police?
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
... Yes?
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
Oh. Okay.
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
That's some cold shit.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Nice fellow?
It don't look like a leopard to me.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
What do you want to see him for?
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
The elderly man I told you about.
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches 
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
We're old friends.
No.
Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
What did he have to do - look at the body?
The whole town's in a state, Kiki doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night 
And not a sign of the leopard?
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
No. Thank you. Ill be fine...
Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
You... You found that at Leons?
Excuse me?
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
When did you get back?
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
Why... I dont know what youre talking about.
Leon could still have hung himself.
Good.
Why do I feel I neednt answer that?
Five years of it. Surely, youd have divorced him if he disgusted you?
You splendid bastard...
Something like that.
Simplify and damn.
Should I?
I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
No. Not us...
My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged...
I dont know. Everyones dead...
Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Croissants. Like that...
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didnt have any. I used a British passport. My names not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
Dont fall asleep with your hair wet.
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.
Who knows. Who cares...  You wanted slime. You got slime.
Its up to you whether they walk or not.
Huh! And they say charitys only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
No. Youre looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there.  Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit...  Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?
Have we done business before?
What sort have you got?
Yeah.
How much of a hurry are you in?
I see. How much?
Yes. Friedmans the fuckin Austrian!
Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. Hes got a safe...  I need a doctor...
Where is it?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
No.
Should I?
Oh... We split up.
Its not.
Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry. 
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
Then why arent you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
When... Im told he came here...
I dont know what your problem is, but...
Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
Could someone have hurt you that bad?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
Havent you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? Id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
Yeah... But he didnt beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
Theyre German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. Its not guilt, more of a curse...  And then theres something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think thats just one of Leons dark delusions...
Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
Oh, I... She just moved. Ive got her new... Its in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
Im sorry. Its just you dont look local...
Uh-huh.
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Three...
Glucks dead, you sonofabitch!
Why did you kill him?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Mossad?
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
... if she can find me? -- That's a brilliant idea!  If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man!  Bring her up!
Yes, my lord.
Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
I thought you were an archer?
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
One day you will.
Good.
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
Quite a few.
Didn't you also carry a banner?
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
Performing a miracle.
Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
God defeated the English, not me.
And God who allowed you to be caught?
No no, I'm fine, really...
The voice was in your cell?
What did it tell you?
Many things...
No... I want to be confessed.
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
You did well...
... You look wonderful...
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Go on to the next question.
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
Good.  Where are the English?
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
The wind will be against us...
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
Perfectly.
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
But my voices... they promised me...
I... submit to Our Lord.
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
Yes, but...
Who gave you that horse?
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
I -- I -- I...
I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
Yes!
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
Why not?
Why would they?
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
What for?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Yes...
I need to confess.
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Him?
Only God knows the answer to that.
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
No one plays Chopin like you.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
How will we sleep?
You know what we do? We use psychology.
You'll be deported.
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
I'm not going anywhere.
No, I don't think so?
Show me.
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
Watch his hand
To be deaf?
That is good, yes.
Yes, it's unholy.
Yes, I thought that.
You don't want to learn.
You mean in signs?
Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
What will I play?
No, no cops!
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house.  Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
I'm busy, Floyd.
They workin' for anybody?
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Good lad.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
You never do, kid.
If I can find a mob that'll risk it. But no matter what happens, I don't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it's not enough... cause it's all you got.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
That's why he won't know it.
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
No.  What's wrong with the front?
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.
Just as long as I get to finish the play.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
You weren't hired to miss him.
All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
No.
Do you suppose.....  ?
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
Then what are you hiding?
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
What do you mean?
You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
Yes.
How did you ever remember me?
Probably not.
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
Yes.
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Why... in the heart.
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Forgive me.  How are you?
This is my wedding.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
That's one thing I won't forget.  Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting.
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
Only in bad weather.
Better get home before it is.
Yes... yes.
We were looking for this bird.
What's that to you?
Who's your candidate?
Who're you calling?
Trail him!  Trail who?
--was Wynant's.
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
Where were you?
Chris!
Just what I said I'd do.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
What did you do with the rest?
I'm not telling anyone.
Never mind.
No.
Is Julia going with you?
No word at all?
You're always teasing.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Yes...
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
Who is she?
What are you drinking?
I'd like to see you work.
There's one coming.
I'll get some towels. 
Did I give it to you?
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
What's the matter with you?
Goodbye, darling.
Sure I will.
He was down in the shop.
Nick!
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
Couple of months anyway.
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Who fired you?
Turn the car around.
Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
Low on gas.  Got to refill.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
Break it out.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
Weird they didn't chase us.
Ready when you are.
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
You said he was a deserter.
Then step aside.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
Wes--
You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- at-at--
Knock it off!
There might be something in there.
OH MY GOD!
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
Roger that.
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
Let's go.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
Stay low.
What?
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
He's not going to leave us.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
How!?
We can't just leave him.
What if he's not?
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
And you; you've got it all together.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
No!
Yeah, I guess we should.
I don't have a weapon.
Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
With what?  Against how many?
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Yeah.
A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
Oh yeah.  Accidently.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
For real?  A treasure?
Why would they do all that if we weren't?
You ever think about dying?
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
Yeah, we're down.
You want to say some words?
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
Correct.  Origin?
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
It's 3+27 hundred
But...you...
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
AH UGH.
They're watching us now.
Incredible!
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
What's going on?
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
What have you done, Cut your hand?
No!....
You don't know that!
What do you want?
Where are they?
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Anything else I should know?
Don't push it, slick.
Drive.
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver?
Why do you do it?
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
Your partner?
What... ?
Right.
It's from an IRA.
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
Reilly! He's loaded!
I know. I warned them.
Security.
But sir--
Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
Don't talk.
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
Yes, sir.
Yes, M'sieu Laval!
<u>Tonsili!</u>
The type they marry.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
Yes, Baron.
I want to see-- 
I hope so, too.
And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
I've got to see you.
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
You say I am a crook.
Thank you.
You're very welcome.  Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything ... And let me say this with love in my heart-- Countess, you are a thief.  The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket.  In fact, you tickled me.  But your embrace was so sweet ... 
Sweetheart, what day is today?
The fourteenth of May.
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
The pleasure is mine, madame.
Naturally I did.
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
Isn't that wonderful!  You see, madame-- 
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
I'll be delighted.
Um-hum ...
Together.
Call the police?
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Then why did you do it?
But you saw it here.
You're certain?
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Get that outta my face.
Don't drop it Rose.
Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
No, trust me, you want to take this call.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
I felt like black.
I always win, Jack. One way or another.  Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
Bollocks.
No you won't.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
So don't marry him.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Well, I guess I will tonight.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
It's okay. I'm alright.
Right.
Right.
It's so cold.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
Would you like anything?
I should like to see my drawing.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
Will you leave me alone?
Thanks.
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
Not at all.
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
So you washed it off!
Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
I'll be there--Good-by.
Sorry.
Lonesome?
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
We coulda got two third-class!
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
Are you screwy?
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Swell!
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
Why, I--
Thanks. That makes us square.
Then you don't have to tell her--cut out New York.
Back is in New York.
So what?
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Are you happy?
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Get that out of your trunk.
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
I went for four.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
Thank you.
Sure, Sis.
Because you ran after me.
Isn't that a daisy?
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Nice voice.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Good.  That's real good.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
We're gonna get along just fine.
Excuse me?
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Yeah, you look it.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
All right, lunger.  Have at it.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
Not exactly...
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
So're the Cowboys.  They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us.
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
Just answer.
Room service.
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
Drop his horse.
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
Sure...
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
Yeah, and dangerous.
We'll see about that.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
- Four wheel drive?
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
Is that any way to say hello?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing.  In fact, I was never here.
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
You too.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
Blood or Dutch?
He was my father's best friend!
If not?
We blast through.
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
Sabotage?
I am. What do you want?
Captain Morton.
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
The Queen invited you to dinner -
Yes -
Seems to be back to normal, sir.
- I told you! He was there! -
A hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization.  And now that I'm being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same condition: A barren, lifeless rock.  The gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless British government who wouldn't listen.
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
You disappoint me, Number Three.
What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???
We got the same thing.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
You were in hell?
It was nip and tuck.
He will be alright.
It is just a regular card.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
You must have done something to her.
Hattie is a different person now.
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
Where was the last place you left him?
Right here in the van.
What?  What is it?
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
Can!
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
Sure is a hairy fellah.
No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
No.
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Sorry.
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
Shhh!
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Yes Sir!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Everyone, it's Woody!
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
Have you been replaced?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
It's busted.
That's right.  Your toys.
No, Slink --
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
She got away.
Didn't you know he made things?
Home is where the heart is.
Go away.
I've got a present for you...
So had I.
Nothing is left but us.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
No.
How much?
That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
Me, too.
Why?
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
Sorry, but I mean, come on.
Just watching you.
I got that.  How was your day?
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
Live with your parents?
I'm third in my class.
What is this, like freebase?
It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume?
Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman.
Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test. I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
So what's it doing in Tijuana?
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
Noriega is a criminal.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
Any idea how much?
That would be very helpful to me.  Also, I received the offer from DEA and the FBI to train some of my men at Quantico.  I think this will be extremely useful, a good way for us to absorb some of your methods.
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized.
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
Christ.
Where are you going, Diane?
Shut up.
Can I see you again?
Certainly not.
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
Aye.
But try too hard --
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing?
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
But you don't have the money?
That's tough.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
You doubt me?
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
Bob?
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
The power was within you.
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
Yes, Captain.
Let me do something.
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
"a"... "n"...uh, "d"... end of word.
Fire the rockets!
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
The ship needs its Captain.
No special conditions?
What makes you think I won't turn us around?
  
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
I cannot go with you.
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
Senior exec.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
If you think -
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
Yeah, I... oops!
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
The Users...you really think they're still there?
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
How?
Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
I had to...in the games...
I'm shocked.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
Yeah, right.
Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history.
In the helicopter.
What?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick me up at eight.  The de-brief is at ten hundred.
Fourteen, Harry.
I thought you moved out.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
Yes what?
Oral hygiene?
Sure.  Say that now.
Good thinking, honey.
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
Uh huh.
Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
He needed my help.
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Would you say he was boring, then?
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
What?
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
What about the husbands?
Those idiots.
Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
You can trust me completely.
It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
You'll call me then?
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
How?
His wife.
I didn't get any chicken.
Is that your real name? Really?
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
'Bout twelve.
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
No. Not particularly.  How come?
What kinda music do you like?
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
She OD'd, didn't she?
"Heroes For Sale"?
That dazzling imagination.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.
Yeah.
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Get the fuck outta here!
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
I know.
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Let me handle this.
Yeah?
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
Who's Sonny Chiba?
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!
Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
Me too, Boris.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Do you still have friends on the force?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
You were a cop.
Nope.
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
I got some money I can give you -
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
I give up. Who are you?
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
I don't believe you.
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Thank you.
That was a good fuckin' movie.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
No.
Shut up!
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
So that...???
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
July?!
What year do you think it is?
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
See -- you can drive after all!
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
The gun! ... I lost it
It was?  I didn't...know.
I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
I need to make a telephone call.
Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
Not, "what", babe!  When!
Plan?  What are you talking about?
You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
You want something?
That a fact?
It is not.
Out of here.
Thirty even.
Harlin around?
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Listen, man.  I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
What would a truck stop be without beer?
Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?
John . . .
What do you want?
How could I?  I was sleeping.
Maybe I don't want you to.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
No trouble at all, really.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
Lied?  What do you mean?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Because I know you're full of shit.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls.
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
Put some clothes on him.  When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert.  It'll takes days for anybody to find him.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
It's our money.  He had no right to take it.
You could give me the gun.
But you said we could be together.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
And you're not one to lie, are you?
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
Husband . . .?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
I'm a solid man.
John Stewart.
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
About what you said this morning.
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
For what?
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
And as soon as I see that you're on your way.
Thirty-thousand dollars.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Christ no!
I said I was sorry.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Oh, shit!
This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
I'm her husband.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
Like you don't know.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
I need thirteen.
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
Two-hundred dollars?
I've had time to get over it.
You're too quick for me.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
How old are you?
What the hell are you talking about?
What's your name anyway?
Will you shut up!
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
What sign?
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
You got the money?
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
No.
Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
No! No police.
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Maybe I don't want you to.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Come here.
I have an idea.
You know what I want.
Try me.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
I'm sorry...
Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
You already have.
What are you talking about?
<u>I don't know why</u>!
Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...
But we all need that too. Hold him.
Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
One way.
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
Like you helped her, Jake?
What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just cause you Russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything...
Oh.
How old is Jeb?
Four.
Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time...
I have a lock on the door.
Oh.
Yes.
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have.
Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
You thought he was carrying a knife?
I don't know what you're asking?
One last question.
No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
Jeremy listen to what--
That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
Okay.
...And everyone lived happily ever after.
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
Building his porch!
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, I guess.
WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... "friends."
Oh.
No?
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
What's your name?
I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys.
D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell.
But... if he doesn't miss?
Is... is it... loaded?
Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
Yeah, I guess so.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
After a ways.
He's in there.
Yup.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
You can shoot him.
Just SHOOT!
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
You ain't shot.
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
This Kid, what's he like?
Nor Quincy, I guess.
No. I mean...  ...an' get yourself a woman? You know?
I didn't see nothin' planted.
You're marking us, Bill.
HEY, KID.
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Best we move that pig.
More.
Fuck you.
An' if I spot 'em?
Who ?
They just said they wanted time.
I don't know. This is bad.
Three million?
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
We'll see.
Tell him we'll meet.
What'the fuck is that?
What?
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
The D.A. gave me immunity.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
I don't
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
Yes.  It would be.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Well, we...
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Neurology?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
I wouldn't do it.
Just now...
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
I am on the staff of...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
Yes.
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket.  You follow me?  I'm trying to help you.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
Exception!
Let me talk to Mickey.
Missus...
Why?
Yes.  It was, actually.
...and is that serious?
Do you want me to go...?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
Yes.
Who told you that?
Is there going to be a later...?
Call the A.M.A.  to Laura) ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody...you have to find this nurse...
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
Uh ...
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
...I'm going to need your help...
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
...he's a good man...
I had a good teacher.  McLean versus Urban Transport...
Yeah.
The Hospital...?
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
She did?
Thanks, Franky.
That's for sure, Frank.
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
What happened in those three...
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
I married into it.
No.
No.
I want you.
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
Do you live here in the hotel?
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Then will you for me?
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
No? Then what?
Please! And don't look at me.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
But why?
Is that the best you can do?
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
That's what I had in mind.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
Oh, yeah. There.
Why?
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
This afternoon.
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
You like it, too.
What?
...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
No... this is the first time for me, too.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
What?
No.
Well... anywhere in particular?
The tall trees...
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
Home?
Vaguely...
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
Oh!
Normal.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Yeah.
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
For what?
I'll take you home.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Out!
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Well...
Well that's what I said.
First of all...
She's dead.
You're not a team player.
The hell I don't.
Just stop.
Sure, why not.
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
Who? What are you talking about?
Later.
I know and I'm honored...
I know...
It has to be done.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
So where's that leave us?
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Call 911.
Go ahead.
He is not cracking up.
Okay fine.
Fine? Fine what?
Not true.
And what happens when you can't?
Then what do they have?
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
What?
I do.
The wedding cake check?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
How could I know what else I forgot?
Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
He is.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
So what do we do?
I need your help.
We're leaving in three hours.
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
Not yet.
Well I do.
No baby. We'll all be right in.
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
We're not canceling.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
What does that mean?
Move the bodies.
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
I don't hear it.
Greenpeace?
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
What song?
Give them to Refugio.
Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
You have no feelings toward ...
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
Don't you ever see him?
Maybe ...
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
Yes, sir.
That's fifteen by seven?
That doesn't matter; I like it.
Let her do what she wants. She doesn't bother us in any way. She minds her business and we ...
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
Come with me.
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
When you are, miss.
Hello.
From the terrace.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
Me? What did I do?
Whatever.
Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
I need your help--
I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.
Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
I understand... I understand perfectly.
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
Of course you are.
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
A little less than yesterday.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
I've been in prison, remember?
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Nothing.
Start of what?
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
That, or living through him...
That's why I'm asking.
Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty!
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.

Izzat the thing...
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
He's not fine.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's, he, uh...?  He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...?  What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get nervous.
Who's got the story?

Oh really.
I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer...What's your favorite drink?
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life.
Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
Start unloading.
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
...Work okay?
Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?
Whatever night you like.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
What'd you tell him?
We are?
It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.
What was that?
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Okay.
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
No sir, that would've been illegal...
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
Well, why stop at that?
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
Get the hell out!
...how do you know? You wish...
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
He still likes you
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
Suffer?  We're living in America.
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Thank you Jenkins
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Thank you
Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards!
No Jonathan.
Oh that explains everything.
This. is killer.
Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
Maybe before the event, never after.
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
It's only two hours away.
I know that.
Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
A ghost?
Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
Do you really think so?
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
Try to communicate with her somehow.
You think that'll help?
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
Have you been hurt?
You were in an accident?
That can't feel good.
At the party.
I've never even met you.
Right.  I'm sorry.
No.  No, I don't.
I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.
No, I don't.
She never mentioned her father.
I should be going anyway.
Oh God...
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
Jody--
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
What?
Shhh.
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
No.
I think three...
It's Saturday.
Yep.
That's not what I'm sug--
I know.
Is it gone?
Of course.
What kind of whispering?
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
Oh, no...
You didn't?
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
No.  Look!  In the window.
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
Harvey says he's amazing.
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
I felt you...looking through me...
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
Yes.  The ghost.
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
What?
She can't be here without me.
Huh.
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Come.  There is a lot to read
Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
The lamplight.  That's all.
She didn't feel them
Help us.  Do what you can.
You bastard...
But have I...?  Ever...?!
I do not understand...
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
And whose houses do you design...?
You still feel that crazy...?
Really...?  Your family there...?
He fools around with his patients too.
Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
Mad. for each other.
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Mm-hmm...
No.    This is unreal...
Talking to me dear...?
Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
Stop it!
No.
That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
I'm sorry - I didn't think
Yes it is...
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
Yes - I have had it for years.
It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
And how many people have you killed?
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
No - I'll have you after
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
I'm your landlady
No - a dentist
Don't worry about it -
Yes...?
Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Yeah, whatever.
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
I love those springy head puppies!
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
We reinvented ourselves.
If you don't have...I mean...
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
So that's a maybe?
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
I guess.
Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
I will not have my boys arguing.
They're in the ignition, silly.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Hmmm?
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
You want it in writing?
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Are they okay?
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
I don't get the distinction.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
To the best hiding place in the world.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
He's on the move?
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
That's refreshingly deviant.
I'm very aural.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
But how would we pay our bills?
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
Of course I like girls.
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
Me? The King of Coitus?
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
My job. Back off, Benedict.
She's going to wash your Jeep?
Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
Suzie Toller is missing.
Back to the land of grownups.
The skinny brunette.
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
Lombardo's settlement?
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come."
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
Just tell us what happened.
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
You can trust me.
Nothing.
I think we just need to get wasted.
So you got my mom's money.
We have to stick with the plan.
I don't know.  I want to see you...
I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
You got something against cigarettes?
That's cop bullshit.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
Shut up.
Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
The one you bought at school.
And she wanted to talk.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
Shit. Here we go again.
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Goodbye, Sandra.
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
Well... that, too.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
Relax.  We're almost there.
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
Where have you been?
In the next two minutes?
You tell me.
You bring the best out in a man.
No, sir... just a businessman.
Dr. Loveless?
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
When are they coming?
In an hour they're gone!
What is Tir Asleen?
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
Let me see it.
Madmartigan.
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
Miserable Pecks.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Of course!  I promise!
Why?
Courage, Willow.
Shut up.
Madmartigan.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
I thought I was the English.
English, Yankee. It's the same. My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.  You look plain, Book.  Very plain.
It's been a while.
No matter. Come with me. We can always use a good carpenter.
Sure have, Sam.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
They kid a lot.
You couldn't wait until morning?
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
I know.
You're so sure of that?
Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
Say again?
I admit I don't know where he is.
But... if you had to guess?
John said you're Amish.
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
No? Why not?
Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
I know.
That is idle talk.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
I wish dawdie was with us.
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
Oh -- all right.
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
If she?
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
Not so fast!  Not....
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Aw, come, come, come --
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
No --
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
My mouth -- my mouth!
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh-oh-
What sort of an animal is that?
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Oh, come on.
Ohh!
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Did I scare you?
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Leave her alone!
Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
I don't know.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
Whozat?
You mean she bit you?
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
It makes you nervous?
Th.D.?
Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
The inside man?
Its I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
Im sorry.
He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
...you should rest.
Then take me with you.
Someone wants to kill me, Id rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
Really?
He used your exact words.
Oh James.
Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
Its heading for the oil terminal.
Still no contact yet.
I would like to use the bathroom --
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
We don't know that.
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
I won't do that.
Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
Adrian -- you've lost it.
Im not.
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
I don't know their real names.
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
What about you?
Looks like a diner.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
Go to hell.
Mind your business.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
That one I'm real familiar with.
You're joking, right?
I thought that was in detail.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
The corner. Anarchy 99.
A parachute. This does not argue well.
It's like you said, every man for himself.
When else are you gonna do it?
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
What's "Anarchy 99"?
You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
Its core?
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
If necessary.
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
I felt like she almost killed me.
Enough for a test.
Oh, shit.
Baack!
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
Surprised?
Yes, don't worry.
Promise??
I promise.
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Oh, darling -- so will I.
You bet your boots it does.
I suppose you're right.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
Break that old man's violin.
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
But, sir...
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
I thought you wanted to.
What wockers?
The wockers with the knockers.
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
How?
That's not bad.
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
It's alive!
Well...
I don't know.  It just woke me up.
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
Not fooling around.
Of course not.
We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
Why don't we talk inside?
...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
Food!
Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Which one?
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
